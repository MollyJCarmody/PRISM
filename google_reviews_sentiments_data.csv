Amazon Corporate Headquarters,Seattle,artificial intelligence,technology,"Sure! Here‚Äôs a scathing review for Amazon customer service:

Title: Worst Customer Service Experience Ever!

I have never encountered a more frustrating and incompetent customer service team than Amazon‚Äôs. I had an issue with a package that never arrived, and after spending HOURS on the phone and in chat, I was met with nothing but scripted responses and zero actual help. Every representative I spoke to either gave me conflicting information or transferred me to someone else who was just as clueless.

The worst part? They REFUSED to issue me a refund or a replacement for a package that their own tracking system said was lost! Instead, they kept repeating the same robotic line: ‚ÄúPlease wait a few more days.‚Äù Wait for what? A package that is clearly not coming?!

To make matters worse, when I finally got fed up and asked to speak to a supervisor, I was either put on hold indefinitely or mysteriously ‚Äúdisconnected.‚Äù Convenient, right? Amazon loves taking our money, but when it comes to actually solving problems, they are nowhere to be found.

I have been a loyal customer for years, but after this nightmare, I am seriously reconsidering giving them another dime. If you ever have an issue with your order, good luck‚Äîyou‚Äôll need it.

Microsoft Azure,Seattle,cloud computing,technology,"I am writing to express my disappointment with the process of purchasing the Microsoft 365 Family Military Appreciation Edition and the challenges I encountered throughout.

I initially attempted to purchase the product for the advertised price of $69.99 on Microsoft's website. However, the purchase process redirected me to the military Exchange website, where the actual price was $99.99, not $69.99 as advertised.

To resolve this, I contacted customer support and was guided by a salesperson who assured me that I would be refunded the $30 difference after completing the purchase. Following their instructions, I purchased a Microsoft 365 gift card, believing it was an immediate download with a product key, as the salesperson indicated.

I spent over two hours on the phone, being transferred multiple times between sales and billing, trying to resolve the issue and determine why the purchase wasn‚Äôt visible on Microsoft‚Äôs end and why I didn‚Äôt receive a product key. Ultimately, I was informed that I had purchased the wrong item, resulting in me having to cancel my purchase through the Exchange. Mind you, the link on Microsofts website brings you to this product which is not a digital download, rather a gift card that is mailed to you. Because of this, I was then told they could no longer honor the advertised price or the $30 difference because it was a gift card and not a digital download.

Even now, I am still trying to complete my purchase, having spent an additional 58 minutes on hold with Microsoft as I write this. The entire process has been unnecessarily complicated, misleading, and frustrating.

I urge Microsoft to review this experience and take steps to ensure that:

-Advertised prices are consistent with the actual prices at the point of purchase.
-Sales and support representatives provide clear and accurate information about the purchase and delivery process.
-The process for military customers purchasing this edition is streamlined and better supported.

This experience has been far below the level of service I expect from a company of Microsoft‚Äôs reputation. I hope my feedback can lead to improvements in both the purchasing process and customer support for others in the future.",1/21/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

I also had other medical issues contributing to inflamed gums even though I floss and brush regularly.  When I went in, the doctor was abrupt and engaged in shaming me for the shape of my gums and that I will need a crown.  She emphasized this was my fault, asked me to grade myself on how well I care for my teeth/gums, didn't inquire about con current medical issues contributing and then said, ""Oh we will check the crown at your next annual appointment"" (so it's not an emergency).  I'm glad she won't be the on going dentist as shaming your patient and blaming them is one of the reasons people do not go to the dentist.  There are better ways to address issues.

Then when she was one a gentleman comes over and sits down, he doesn't introduce himself or let me know what's doing on. Now some of the questions I was asking the lady who was cleaning my teeth she said it would be best if I ask my doctor because she only deals with the cleaning part and guns, which was fine I understand.  But the doctor was horrible,  he has horrible manners and for a doctor/dentist that's even more disappointing. He kept yaking my teeth not even explaining to me what he was doing  and then he sprayed something that was so cold it hurts alot and then I told him it hurt and after that he put his stuff down and said he was and will walk me to the front.

He did not explain to me what he was doing, he did not give me my after care summary and instructions,  I basically just left there not even knowing what was wrong with my teeth.

St. Louis Dental Center,St Louis,dental care,healthcare,"Oh my goodness, I need to rave about this dental clinic! Coming from someone who's been through the dental wringer, I was super nervous walking in. See, I had this whole mess with my back teeth, plus damage from when someone who wasn't really qualified messed with my permanent bonded retainer (pro tip: don't let just anyone remove and reattach those!).

This amazing student dentist Gina did what seasoned dentists struggle with - she pulled two infected teeth like she was born doing it! The crazy part? ZERO PAIN. None! Like, how is that even possible?And here's the kicker - she's still in training! Could've fooled me because she worked like a total pro.

The supervising dentist was fantastic too - such a great teacher and you could tell they really knew their stuff. And can we talk about the vibe there? In most big dental offices, you can cut the tension with a knife, but not here! The whole place just radiated good energy. Everyone got along so well, and as someone who's the biggest dental scaredy-cat ever, I felt so comfortable and cared for.

Gina, if you're reading this - you're going to be one of the great ones! Your patience, skills, and compassion are off the charts. I've had some nightmare experiences before (don't even get me started about the time a lady nearly ripped my mouth apart taking x-rays and then yelled at me! üò±), but this place? Pure gold.

Bottom line: If you're nervous about going to a dental school clinic, DON'T BE! These folks - especially Gina - are bringing their A-game and treating patients better than some fancy private practices I've been to. As I looked around I noticed pretty much everyone was even happy I didn't really hear any bickering or any unhappy customers leaving. I'm actually looking forward to my next visit, and trust me, that's saying something!

She was so upset. I tried to call her, but I grew frustrated with her. In comes Dominique who was calm and reassured that she was in good hands with Delilah. Delilah was a God sent, who was made to do the work that she does. She helped to calm my teen daughter by being transparent and taking a much gentler approach than myself. In the end, with help of these two remarkable women, the experience was a success.

After struggling to get quality dental care at another chain provider in Seattle, I turned to Dental Care Seattle, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. They quickly got me in to examine some issues I‚Äôd been having with a recent filling done elsewhere. From the moment I entered the clinic, I could tell this practice was professional and patient-focused.

Becca made me feel like part of the Dental Care family right away, and I was thoroughly impressed by the level of professionalism from both her and Dr. Radandt. They conducted a comprehensive examination and were able to accurately diagnose my issue. I assumed I‚Äôd need to schedule a follow-up appointment to resolve the problem with my filling, but they were able to repair it immediately!

During the procedure, they were incredibly attentive to my well-being as a patient, demonstrated exceptional skill, and worked seamlessly as a team.

Additionally, I was charged for a separate filling that was not covered by my insurance, forcing me to pay out of pocket. Despite multiple calls to Crown Hill Dental over several months, it was difficult to obtain my records and an explanation of why the filling was necessary. I had no prior issues with the tooth and I've never not had a filling be covered by insurance, I would have appreciated more transparency in my care.

Seattle Crown Hill Dental,Seattle,dental care,healthcare,Just okay. Firstly I had to reschedule my appointment because of their system malfunction which was the first of multiple inconveniences. When I arrived 10 mins early and checked in everything seemed fine but then over 15 minutes after my appointment was supposed to start I had to go to the front desk and ask what was going on. Once I asked I was taken back so who knows how long I would have waited if I didn‚Äôt ask. While doing the cleaning the suction was dropped out of my mouth twice which caused water to be sprayed all over me with the leaf suction. After the cleaning I was supposed to get some residual glue taken off my teeth from a previous dental procedure. I waited 20 mins for the doctor to come back and finally grind it down. Also I was supposed to be given a reference to another doctor but that was also forgotten by the team. Overall I spent 35 mins just in waiting time. I‚Äôll try once more because the doctor was knowledgeable and it‚Äôs close to my house but not the best first impression on a new patient.,11/14/24,2,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Downtown Seattle Dentists,Seattle,dental care,healthcare,"I‚Äôve been a patient at this practice for about 3 years and loved it at first, when my dentist was Donna Le-Barnes. Now that she‚Äôs no longer there, the level of care provided has plummeted drastically. I am moving to a new practice as we speak.

My issues:
* I have an Invisalign plan with them, and at first, they were able to provide excellent care for that but now, the buttons they put on fall off same day sometimes or the following week. Their staff is not knowledgeable and/or trained  well enough to provide adequate service. I was so frustrated that I even considered getting legal advice because they do not seem to be able to provide the services they advertised.
* Another concern is that they will randomly book me to different dentists for exams if the primary provider is out of office. They didn‚Äôt even check in with me to ask if this is an issue. I only like to see my dentist and her team because the others at this location are pretty awful. My last cleaning (about 6-7 months ago) was one of the worst I‚Äôve ever had - not only was the hygienist bad at what she does and let me choke on my spin and water but she was also talking to me about things that were making me very uncomfortable.
* Lastly, I had an emergency this morning and asked if they would please reschedule my appointment and they said that they would have to charge me $100 for that. I‚Äôve always been early to all appointments throughout the years and have been super considerate and careful but they wouldn‚Äôt even give me one pass when I desperately needed it. This was the one and only time and they still couldn‚Äôt help. NOTE: they do have a policy that says if you need to reschedule less than 48 hours in advance, you may be SUBJECT to pay $100, which sounds like it‚Äôs a personal choice to them who gets a pass and who doesn‚Äôt. That does not feel right to me.

Also, note that they do not have parking available in the building so you‚Äôll need to find a garage and pay for it if you‚Äôre driving.

The only redeeming thing for this place is the team who used to work under Dr Le-Barnes. They are really gentle and consistent and I will miss them.

I would NOT recommend this place. There are many other dentists who offer Invisalign and I would say any of them will be better than this one.",1/22/25,2,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

First Hill Dental Center - Dr. Singh DMD,Seattle,dental care,healthcare,"Worst experience ever, all the doctor cares about is money. I couldn‚Äôt prioritize my Invisalign treatment because of life events and traveling for a few months. I finally collected courage to go in and have my teeth checked out again. They just took off my attachments and told me I have to pay another $1500 in order to get new trays, because I didn‚Äôt go to their office in the last few months. Context is that I paid for the comprehensive plan which should include rescans for free.

I then asked for my Invisalign contract because I wanted to see it written down that I have to pay extra for rescan. But there was NOTHING, no binding contract existing, so they felt like they can do whatever they wanted. The doctor kept saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs common sense that if I don‚Äôt come in I had to pay extra,‚Äù and was very belittling, and had no empathy for what I had gone through. In the past few months, they did not once called and told me that if I don‚Äôt come in, I needed to pay. I would understand it if it was in the contract that I had to pay more, but they were literally just pulling out the number out of nowhere. DO NOT COME HERE.

Roosevelt Dental Center,Seattle,dental care,healthcare,"I cannot recommend Dr. Abedi enough! I am a dentist myself and have been a patient of Dr. Abedi for more than a decade. His expertise, dedication to patient care, and genuine compassion sets him apart. Dr. Arman Abedi and his staff go above and beyond to ensure every patient feels comfortable and well cared for, and their attention to detail is truly remarkable.
It's a pleasure to collaborate with such an amazing professional and I have the utmost confidence in his ability to provide exceptional dental care. If you's looking for an honest dentist who truly puts patients first, Dr. Arman Abedi is the one!",12/18/24,5,POSITIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Roosevelt Dental Center,Seattle,dental care,healthcare,"My dentist, Arman Abedi, recommended I wear an NTI-tss bite guard in early 2018, a decision that caused damage to my dental health. This device is known to cause an open bite in 5% of users‚Äîa condition where the front teeth no longer touch due to jaw shifting. This risk is well-documented, including on the manufactures website, and avoidable with proper monitoring during the first few months of use. However, I was never informed of this risk or monitored. I wore the device nightly, as instructed, for 18 months, attending regular cleanings with Dr. Abedi, and not once was the potential issue addressed. This could all have been avoided if in the first few months I was monitored for any jaw movement. At this point, I could have stopped wearing the device and the jaw would have returned to its normal position.

By the time my condition worsened‚Äîleaving only one molar touching when I closed my mouth‚ÄîI was switched to a full guard, with no acknowledgment that the NTI-tss device he recommended was the cause. I had to pay out-of-pocket for Botox injections to manage the resulting increased grinding I was experiencing, totaling nearly $10,000 over the next couple of years before I ended up getting jaw surgery. Insurance usually does not cover Botox injections for TMJ. It was only after consulting oral surgeons and TMJ specialists that I learned the NTI-tss was the likely cause of my open bite, how it could have been avoided and how common this is for people who wear this type of device.

This lack of transparency and care has left me with ongoing damage. Over the past six years, I‚Äôve endured severe grinding that has damaged my back teeth, spent thousands on Botox and medical appointments, undergone a difficult double jaw surgery, and am now two years into Invisalign post operative care. My jaw is still misaligned.

The most frustrating part is that this could have been avoided. Risks associated with the NTI-tss are clearly stated on the manufacturer‚Äôs website and many others‚Äîlikely due to the resulting lawsuits‚Äîbut Arman Abedi either failed to inform me, didn‚Äôt know or chose not to. This negligence has cost me nearly $20,000 (including the surgery and orthodontic cost) and years of pain and treatment. I can‚Äôt emphasize this last point enough, literal years of pain, discomfort and treatment due to one person‚Äôs negligence, Arman Abedi. Ironically, about a year into using the device, I was informed that I could wear an additional device on my top teeth but was warned that it might cause an open bite. I was adamantly against risking such an outcome, yet I had unknowingly been doing exactly that for a year simply because I wasn‚Äôt informed.

While I liked Roosevelt Dental and had a great hygienist, I cannot recommend Arman Abedi due to his negligence. Seattle has plenty of dentists‚Äîchoose one who prioritizes your health and fully informs you of potential risks. Avoid Arman Abedi, unless you‚Äôre willing to risk significant harm due to negligence.

Posted are images of my jaw after surgery. I was recommended to wear the device in early 2018, I was 33 years old at the time. The surgery took place in October 2022, and I am still undergoing post-operative orthodontic care today. I was very lucky with my teeth up to this point, never needing braces or any type of orthodontic care as a child, and other than minor grinding, had very healthy teeth.",11/18/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

The staff is friendly, competent, thoughtful, and you can just tell that they enjoy working there. Many dental practices plan on people arriving late, so when you arrive on time, you end up waiting for a while - but not here, I was very impressed that they got me in and out quickly for every appointment.

How did they exceed my expectations? There is such a positive energy at this practice exuded by all who work there. This results in greater pride the staff takes in their work, getting things done exceptionally well the first time, and ensuring your needs are met along the way.

Riolo Orthodontics,Seattle,dental care,healthcare,"DR. RIOLO TREATED MY TEETH LIKE THEY WERE HIS OWN, which honestly, I couldn‚Äôt appreciate more! Like, I swear, he put more care into my teeth than I do into my morning caffeine. His dedication to my smile went beyond what words can describe. He approached my teeth with the kind of care one might give to something they truly cherish‚Äîlike a masterpiece they were perfecting, making sure no detail was overlooked. His constant reassurance and thoughtfulness made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt just another patient, but someone whose journey he was deeply invested in.

My journey started in the fall of 2017 when I was referred to Dr. Riolo by a colleague in Seattle, where I began my adventure with SmileRunners (clear retainers), which I continued until the end of 2019. Then, COVID hit us all in 2020, and just before it reached Washington in March, Dr. Riolo informed me that the clear retainers weren't working and suggested I get braces. My front two teeth were like two mafia bosses, each trying to rule their own territory‚Äîconstantly fighting for control, causing chaos and tension. It was like watching two rival families trying to take over the same street. In May 2020, I became a ""metal mouth"" once again (just like high school)‚Äîexcept this time, the entire world was locked down, so no one could see me. Perfect timing, right?

I started visiting the Bellevue office, where Dr. Cousin was completing his residency. Slowly, he and Dr. Riolo began seeing me together. Every couple of months, I'd go in to get my bands changed and pick out fun colors for the season (red for Christmas, green for St. Paddy's Day, etc.). Fast forward to fall 2022, when my braces finally came off, and I was ecstatic! But life had other plans. I went back for a follow-up in spring 2023, and much to my surprise, I found myself back in braces (this time, just for the lower teeth). After many years of trial and error, both doctors worked tirelessly to figure out the root cause of my dental dilemma.

Thanks to the incredible efforts of Dr. Riolo and Dr. Cousin, I am finally out of braces and into retainers, for good! I can‚Äôt thank them enough for their patience, expertise, and unwavering care throughout this entire journey.

When I moved to a new location, Dr. Riolo made sure I was in great hands with Dr. Cousin, and I felt fully supported every step of the way. It‚Äôs been a long road, but I‚Äôm so grateful to them both. They made a sometimes frustrating process feel a lot easier and more manageable.

Thank you, Dr. Riolo, for always listening and making sure my smile‚Äîand confidence‚Äîwere taken care of every step of the way. Your care, kindness, and unwavering attention to detail have made all the difference, and I will always be grateful. God Bless!",2/16/25,5,POSITIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Queen Anne Orthodontics,Seattle,dental care,healthcare,"If you're thinking about visiting Dr. Teja for orthodontic treatment, please hear my story and strongly reconsider.  I visited about 4 different orthodontists in the Seattle area before deciding on her, and I made a big mistake. My treatment began during the summer of 2022, when I was in Seattle. In January of 2023, her office unfortunately had a fire and she was forced to close and relocate her patients to other local dental offices in order to continue to provide treatment (which made scheduling very difficult). I had also been planning to move to California during March of 2023 and I let her know that I would look at local orthodontists and see if the price was going to be an issue and attempt to transfer care.

After moving to California in March of 2023 I realized I would need to pay another new round of orthodontics to transfer, so I decided to remain with her office (to which she agreed). During this time I had some attachments fall off and needed to get them reattached. In October of 2023, Dr. Teja had another emergency in which a family member had passed away, causing her to be unavailable for another 3+ months. During this time, there were only 2 communications sent to me from her office, one in October and one in November.

After waiting for months, I decided to reach out to her office in March of 2024, which I found out she had been back by that time unbeknownst to me. In April of 2024, I flew back from CA to get my teeth rescanned so I could get new aligners. However, her office again failed to notify me and communicate with me for the appointment until I inquired what was going on in June of 2024.

At this point she told me I was being a noncompliant patient and threatened to discontinue treatment for a breach of contract. This was her way I believe of trying to get rid of me as a patient. However, it was her office that was unable to provide timely care, was completely unavailable because of her office fire, and was uncommunicative for months on end, claiming that I was being a ‚Äúnoncompliant patient‚Äù and further refused to continue to provide me orthodontic treatment or give me any sort of refund.

I submitted a formal complaint against her through my insurance company mid-2024. They had a 3rd party orthodontist investigate my case and after months of sending in evidence of communication between us, ruled in my favor and gave me a full refund of the money insurance had paid her. Of course I was relieved but it did not take away the massive headache and unnecessary blame I took (not to mention the initial deposit I made for orthodontics and continued payments, which was unrecoverable via credit card). I do my best to be the most compliant patient as I myself am in the service industry, but this was completely unprofessional and she lacked the self-awareness until a 3rd party had to look into it.

If you‚Äôre on the fence of going to her office- do not. She seems nice and pleasant when you first meet her, but is totally unwilling to see the patient‚Äôs perspective and gave me a terrible experience with orthodontics. There are several other providers in the area with glowing reviews which I will not name but would recommend instead.

EDIT: I am editing my response in order to provide a more complete picture to the reply by Dr. Teja below.
a)Losing my attachments definitely compromised the fit of my aligners, despite what anyone may have ‚Äúthought‚Äù so, hence why I could not put them on.
b & c)The reason minimal progress was made was due to her office only being able to provide me 2-3 appointment dates PER MONTH and hence did not adequately meet the standard of care.
d)I received a release of records. However, her office agreed to continue my care after this (this was documented).

There was a previous review on Yelp for Dr. Teja under ""Gwendolyn H"" that describes exactly how I was treated and felt many times. I often felt invalidated, gaslighted, blamed, and had to put up with defensiveness and dismissal whenever I brought up something she did not like.

HOWEVER, and I am certain this applies to most orthodontics practices, I do not appreciate the assumption that children and families are freely able to put their work and school days on hold for the privilege of scheduling appointments and commuting to and from said appointment. It is disruptive to the child, the parent or chaperone, the child's classroom, parents/guardians having to take time off of work to attend appointments, etc. Please please please offer more early morning and evening appointment times.

"Duan Orthodontics - Chunni Duan DMD, MSc.",Seattle,dental care,healthcare,"My experience at this office was an interesting one.

Everything started off great, but then really fell apart at the end.

I‚Äôve had Invisalign in the past and recently moved to the area wanting to fix slight crowding due after my retainer breaking and teeth shifting back. I had gotten a quote from another orthodontist but came to duan orthodontics for a second opinion. They offered me the treatment with a discount and they were really sweet so I decided to move forward with them.

Communication was a slight struggle during my treatment. I‚Äôd often have appointments thinking it would be for one thing but it would turn out to be something else, but I trusted them so I just kept going.

My teeth looked great at the end of treatment, I was happy.

Then, I went to a new general dentist in Bellevue and they were concerned that my bite was really pressured in the front. They showed me scans of the red in just the front area. They said I shouldn‚Äôt have that especially after just completing Invisalign. So naturally I was concerned too.

I called duan orthodontics frustrated and Victor proceeds to tell me that I chose this treatment and that if I wanted to not have the front teeth impacting, I‚Äôd need to pay more and do more treatment. At this point I‚Äôm beyond frustrated as a patient to be blamed for this as I would have had no idea.

I ask dr duan to call me instead, and she says the same thing as victor, saying I chose this and she doesn‚Äôt have issues with other patients. If I wanted to get this fixed I need to pay. Reluctantly, I get more info on my options and they try to sell me on 4 retainers when I‚Äôve said multiple times I just want the treatment fixed and 1 retainer.

They finally agree and push for me to come in right away (as I‚Äôm driving home from Bellevue at 4 pm) to pay for it. Im telling them my availability and they‚Äôre not listening and offering times I said I wasn‚Äôt available. At this point I‚Äôm feeling such a red flag in my gut. I ask for victor to send me a calendar reminder and he said he will if the system is working. I never got a reminder. Clearly not a priority.

I ended up cancelling and response was ‚Äúno worries‚Äù. This was the most frustrating experience. My teeth look good, but now I'm in a place where they are going to have negative impact if I don‚Äôt fix it and I don‚Äôt trust this place to fix it so I basically have to start all over.

Honestly, I hate to say it because it started so well, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. Beware",1/22/25,2,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

St. Louis Dental Center,St Louis,dental care,healthcare,"Oh my goodness, I need to rave about this dental clinic! Coming from someone who's been through the dental wringer, I was super nervous walking in. See, I had this whole mess with my back teeth, plus damage from when someone who wasn't really qualified messed with my permanent bonded retainer (pro tip: don't let just anyone remove and reattach those!).

This amazing student dentist Gina did what seasoned dentists struggle with - she pulled two infected teeth like she was born doing it! The crazy part? ZERO PAIN. None! Like, how is that even possible?And here's the kicker - she's still in training! Could've fooled me because she worked like a total pro.

The supervising dentist was fantastic too - such a great teacher and you could tell they really knew their stuff. And can we talk about the vibe there? In most big dental offices, you can cut the tension with a knife, but not here! The whole place just radiated good energy. Everyone got along so well, and as someone who's the biggest dental scaredy-cat ever, I felt so comfortable and cared for.

Gina, if you're reading this - you're going to be one of the great ones! Your patience, skills, and compassion are off the charts. I've had some nightmare experiences before (don't even get me started about the time a lady nearly ripped my mouth apart taking x-rays and then yelled at me! üò±), but this place? Pure gold.

Bottom line: If you're nervous about going to a dental school clinic, DON'T BE! These folks - especially Gina - are bringing their A-game and treating patients better than some fancy private practices I've been to. As I looked around I noticed pretty much everyone was even happy I didn't really hear any bickering or any unhappy customers leaving. I'm actually looking forward to my next visit, and trust me, that's saying something!

Premier Dental Partners Central West End,St Louis,dental care,healthcare,"‚õîÔ∏è I strongly advise caution when considering this dental office due to their unprofessional practices. The staff appears disorganized, and our experience has been marred by inefficiencies. My daughter and I were scheduled for appointments over a period of almost three months. Initially, they failed to include us on their schedule, resulting in a wasted trip after taking my daughter out of school. The staff offered to see only one of us, but I declined, as both appointments were necessary, and I preferred not to reschedule. Consequently, they booked another appointment six weeks later. After completing the necessary paperwork and waiting, I received a call two days prior to the appointment, informing me that they do not accept our insurance. This revelation, coming after three months and numerous interactions with staff members, is unacceptable. The issue should have been addressed when I first disclosed our insurance information.

Premier Dental Partners Central West End,St Louis,dental care,healthcare,"My experience with Premier Dental has been nothing short of a nightmare. I was initially treated by Dr. Kofkoff, who recommended and started me on Invisalign treatment. However, when I later saw Dr. Theiss, I was told that Dr. Kofkoff had made a serious error and shouldn't have provided me with this service. Now, despite their conflicting opinions, they refuse to give me a full refund, insisting that I‚Äôm still responsible for paying for the Invisalign treatment!

For the past three months, I‚Äôve been caught in an endless cycle of back-and-forth with no resolution in sight. Even after escalating the issue to their corporate office at Heartland Dental, nothing has been done to resolve my concerns.

This has been an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience. I expected professionalism and clear communication, but instead, I‚Äôve been met with confusion and refusal to take accountability.

I was a patient of Dr. Simone's practice and had consistently invested in dental treatments. However, my experience with Dr. Simone was incredibly disappointing.

I experienced significant pain and discomfort with a replacement tooth. When I expressed my concerns, I was met with a dismissive and unprofessional response. To make matters worse, I was informed that I would no longer be seen as a patient due to missing two appointments (one canceled and one paid for). It seemed to be a direct response to my complaint about the pain in the recently replaced tooth by Dr. Simone.

This decision seemed disproportionate and unfair, especially considering the extenuating circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of her negligence and refusal to take responsibility for her faulty work, I'll now have to pay another dentist to correct the issue.

I was in severe pain from an impacted wisdom tooth. I made an appointment and was seen the following day for an x-ray and assessment. They prescribed me antibiotics to kill the infection prior to my extraction, which was a big relief.

Everyone was very friendly and professional- from the receptionist, to the assistants, to Dr. Johnson who did my extraction. Dr. Johnson was very nice, gentle, and quick with her work- making sure I was properly numb and comfortable. Part of an old filling fell out during the extraction, and Dr. Johnson gave me a new one right there at no extra charge.

Amazon,Seattle,e-commerce,technology,"Sure! Here‚Äôs a scathing review for Amazon customer service:

Title: Worst Customer Service Experience Ever!

I have never encountered a more frustrating and incompetent customer service team than Amazon‚Äôs. I had an issue with a package that never arrived, and after spending HOURS on the phone and in chat, I was met with nothing but scripted responses and zero actual help. Every representative I spoke to either gave me conflicting information or transferred me to someone else who was just as clueless.

The worst part? They REFUSED to issue me a refund or a replacement for a package that their own tracking system said was lost! Instead, they kept repeating the same robotic line: ‚ÄúPlease wait a few more days.‚Äù Wait for what? A package that is clearly not coming?!

To make matters worse, when I finally got fed up and asked to speak to a supervisor, I was either put on hold indefinitely or mysteriously ‚Äúdisconnected.‚Äù Convenient, right? Amazon loves taking our money, but when it comes to actually solving problems, they are nowhere to be found.

I have been a loyal customer for years, but after this nightmare, I am seriously reconsidering giving them another dime. If you ever have an issue with your order, good luck‚Äîyou‚Äôll need it.

1/5 stars, and that‚Äôs being generous.",2/24/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

The first time neither one of us was at home, but we definitely were when they SUPPOSEDLY attempted again this afternoon, at 4:57 PM, and that they would ‚Äúattempt again tomorrow‚Äù. We had Amazon call us through the help/contact part of their site. Did anyone know that they now email you a ‚Äúpassword‚Äù, a 6 digit number, that you have to tell the driver when they come to your door? Well, that would have been all well and good, and we would have figured that out if the driver actually DID come to the door, but NO ONE DID! NO KNOCK! We have a dog that definitely would have alerted us if someone was here. The agent told me that they will ‚Äúattempt‚Äù to deliver again tomorrow. I am livid, asked for a supervisor, and told him that we would be expecting the package TONIGHT, OR ELSE!!! We figure that that won‚Äôt happen, but my husband will be home tomorrow and waiting for another email (if that‚Äôs the new process, but who knows?) and another ‚Äúattempt‚Äù.

So he pulls up our driveway , instead of turning around, he had plenty of room to pull forward and turn around,  he decides to back over a 125 year old completely restored hillside antique plow. See üì∏. We have Google nest cameras and they caught everything on video. Which was submitted to arc, the real idiots of Amazon. They said they would respond within a couple business days. We have yet to talk to Debbie Reams the adjuster.  The state h.p. came out. We have over 7 hours of emails, chats, and over a dozen calls to arc in which we have yet to talk to a person.

Balancing the simultaneous maintenance and innovation of our platform has proven challenging for our bootstrap company, which has effectively managed assets exceeding $2.75 billion for our municipal clients.

Our experience with MoxiWorks and their ActivePipe system has been extremely disappointing. We rely on accurate data for our clients. Unfortunately, the data being pulled by ActivePipe is consistently inaccurate.

Despite reaching out to their customer support multiple times (which is provided by support centers overseas), the issues remain unresolved. The chat support is frustrating and inadequate for dealing with such critical problems. We urgently needed assistance from a knowledgeable representative, but were only met with unhelpful responses.

We have provided documentation of the inaccuracies their system is providing, yet the problem persists.

Kaiser Permanente Washington,Seattle,health insurance,healthcare,"My mother had shoulder surgery here.  I have never been to such a sad surgery center.  The facility is falling apart.  General maintenance and cleaning have a lot to be desired.  Stains on all the walls, torn up mismatched furniture that wasn't even enough to accommodate those who were there, some of which had to sit on the floor.  No information about what was going on or how she was doing.  No information on how long it would take or what was being done.  I've never felt so ignored and confused in a medical facility.  It was an awful experience.  We ended up waiting for 7 hours with little to no information on how she was or how long it would take.  When we live 20 minutes away, it would have been nice to go home instead of sitting in a waiting room that entire time.  We ended up spending 9 hours at there.  Most of the time having no idea what was going on.
It gets worse.  After speaking to my mother after her surgery I was told that the two technicians that were in charge of placing her pain pump could not figure out how to do it and were openly discussing this in front of her.  Ultimately they could not do it and she was not able to have a pain pump and was instead given a pain block.  I overheard from other staff that this was a problem for several patients that day and that people where not able to get their pain pumps.  There were also nurses who were openly discussing another patients care in the room that she was in.  I have multiple nurses in my family and have been in many medical facilities, this isn't my first time going though this, I know Kaiser can do better.",10/26/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Community Health Plan of Washington,Seattle,health insurance,healthcare,"Absolutely worst place to work at. I was hired through a 3rd party, along with four other people. Training was a JOKE, the trainer was a JOKE & management was a JOKE. This is the most unprofessional company I‚Äôve ever worked for. Managers expect you to work six full months without taking ANY time off. Policies are unreasonable. Managers claim ‚Äúthey‚Äôre there for you, and it‚Äôs a safe space‚Äù which is a lie. My training class had an issue that they knew about and continued letting it disrupt our learning experience. Once we spoke yo to our trainer & management, they acted as if they cared & didn‚Äôt. The trainer told us they were FIRING another trainee in our class because sed trainee could not keep up. My recruiter also let it be known that that employee would be getting fired. Which I think is very unprofessional & a violation of privacy. The recruitment company TEK System‚Äôs is no better. Once they got wind of us knowing they were firing someone, they began HARASSING myself & the other 3 trainees. Bombarding us with phone calls, emails, & text messages trying to get the mess  they made under control all while doing this during WORKING HOURS that were supposed to be training. The fact that I had to send my recruiter a message stating that ‚ÄúI come to work to work, and all this he said, she said nonsense and  texting and calling when I‚Äôm supposed to be working is ridiculous. All because she felt the need to tell me about another employees status of employment. You cannot trust a single soul at Community Health Plan of Washington, or TEK Systems. I was literally fired, for calling in sick ONE day after working there for a month all because the recruitment agency and CHPW are never on the same page. Before I stated, I advised the recruiter I had time off I needed. I gave her the dates, she advised me that the company said they couldn‚Äôt give me FOUR days off within a 4 month time frame. My recruiter at the time said she didn‚Äôt agree with that, mainly because I was asking for the time off 4 months ahead of time. My recruiter then states ‚Äúso I reached out to my boss and between the three of us, just call in sick. Don‚Äôt worry, we got you‚Äù closer to the time I needed off, I tried to do it the correct way, again and reached out to my Supervisor. She tells me she‚Äôll have to check with management, and get back with me. She ever does, she reaches out to my recruiters, boss and lets him know about the time I‚Äôm requesting. Management at CHPW told my recruiters boss to talk to me and retract those days. My recruiters boss called me, told me everything that was said and proceeded to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôve talk about this before you officially started so go ahead and call in sick, you‚Äôre good. At this point I‚Äôve been told TWICE by my recruiter and her boss it‚Äôs okay to call in sick. November 3rd at 10:00pm I call in sick for my absence on November 4th for my shift at 8:45am. On November 4th at 5:00pm my recruiter calls and tells me I have been fired. I asked why, and she states because I called in sick and CHPW feels like they gave the training class an extra two days of training and I called out. Being fired for doing what I was told by my recruiter and her boss is insane. Them not having my back is insane. At the end of the day, I‚Äôm happy it happened. I would never work for a company who threatens employees about missing time.

I was planning to go to the Cantina restaurant, which used to be located on their campus, only to find it closed. I was with my three young children‚Äîmy toddler, niece, and nephew‚Äîand decided to show them the colorful walkway, garden, and waterfall on the property. Unfortunately, we were approached by a white security guard who rudely informed us that this was private property.

While I understand the importance of securing private property, the manner in which we were confronted was unprofessional and unnecessary. I've previously dined at the restaurant before its closure and visited the firepit area where others were sitting, without ever being approached by security. If certain areas are restricted, clear signage should be posted to avoid such uncomfortable encounters.

The experience was disheartening, especially since I frequently visit Downtown Clayton and have enjoyed the area. It would be beneficial for Centene to hire friendlier and more professional security personnel. The security officer on duty during weekends, who seemed overweight, was particularly unpleasant.

I spent money and faxed documentation even though they had paid the claim and listed it in my immunization chart. I never received a reward. I called today 1/14/25 after being transferred several times and was told that my coverage had been termed, and I am not entitled to a reward. They could have told me this in December. On another note, I had a claim that was paid in February 2024 for a well-woman's visit that they requested their payment back (10 months later) due to a change in coding.

Home State Health,St Louis,health insurance,healthcare,"Worst mistake ever. 0 STARS!!

Used Home State for my newborn a year ago just until my husband switched jobs, and then we transferred her to his insurance a few months later. We barely qualified for this, so we had to pay $200/month, but we decided to go through with it due to wanting to have peace of mind that she is insured. I wasn't able to apply for her until I got her SSN, which came a month after she was born.

After having to call every day for 2 weeks in order to find the right number for the right person to be able to help me apply, I still had to wait 2 weeks to see if she was accepted. I tried to do it myself online, but that was the most confusing and frustrating thing I've ever attempted, and I wanted to have a rep help me to speed it along and in case I messed it up... after finally getting someone who could help me, we got to the end of the application, she realized she was applying for the wrong thing somehow... and we had to restart... that was a 2 HOUR phone call with a newborn needing me pretty frequently...

I was assured numerous times that they would back start her start day to her birth (saying they always have to do this for newborns) only to find out a fee months into using this insurance that they did not back start. I called at least once a week for 2 months trying to get things cleared up as I started getting multiple attempts from the hospital asking to collect her bill for her hospital stay and her 1st 3 appointments...

After finally finding who go call to ask to back date her insurance, I had to go to my local office only for them to tell me to wait for a phone call... I had to stay their to talk on my own phone, but finally got someone who sounded like they know what to do. She exclaimed that they have to fix this all the time, said it would take about a week, but that it would be fixed. 3 months later, still not fixed and now my bills are in collections due to Home State NOT paying what they said they would... I literally just wasted about $1000 having my child on this insurance for about 5 months only for them to have covered barely anything....

Absolute trash. They make it so incredibly difficult to do anything with them, probably so you'll just give up!",7/16/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Chickpea curry had good flavors but was too salty. The curry was also a bit more spicy which was not mentioned in the dish description.

Fragrant duck was tasty. Juicy on the inside and and crisp on the outside.

Seven flavor beef was good too. My colleague really liked it.

Last but not least, the food was worthwhile.  We started with a ginger vodka martini (delightfully clean and subtlety ginger) and a thai chili margarita, which had a good chili punch with a fresh lime cover.  The tequila was background.
The star of the night was the sea bass lettuce wraps.  The jicima was fresh and juicy, and the sea bass was cooked perfectly, light, and flakey.
The chicken matey was tender, good char, and not dry at all. The peanut sauce could have been more spicy for us. Thank you for a generous serving!!!
The mongolian beef with homemade egg noodles has room for improvement but was still very good.  I like the sweet sauce, but my husband prefers less sweet more spice.  Either way, we agree the noodles missed the mark somehow.  We can't agree on a suggestion for the chef... were they overcooked or too thin, or is it us?

Navos,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"My stay at Navos inpatient care in Seattle was deeply distressing and has left me emotionally scarred. From the moment I arrived, I was met with an environment that was unhealthy, unsanitary, and lacking in basic care.

The food was inedible‚Äîdisgusting and unhealthy to the point where I was starving during my stay. The kitchen did not appear clean, and the water I received looked dirty. Multiple times when I asked for water, staff complained, telling me to come back later. The facility itself was filthy‚Äîthere were bugs in the showers, which were cold, dirty, and barely usable. I was denied basic comforts, such as a pillow. Despite being polite, I was often met with disdain and made to feel like I was insane.

I also faced neglect when it came to my medical care. I arrived with a painful UTI, but despite asking my primary care doctor for help multiple times, it took days for someone to follow up. The psychiatric care I received was just as poor‚Äîthe psychiatrist gave me an extreme dosage of medication, 10 times what two outpatient psychiatrists later said they would have prescribed. This led to severe akathisia, dizziness, and discomfort. When I nearly passed out from dizziness and laid on the ground, not a single staff member stopped to help.

The level of communication was abysmal, with doctors and nurses rarely explaining treatment plans or offering any meaningful support. There were long periods where I was left feeling isolated, with no understanding of what was happening or when I would be able to speak with someone about my condition.

I was left bored, lonely, and isolated for most of my stay. The only activities were group therapy and TV in the cafeteria, neither of which were stimulating or helpful. The lack of meaningful support left me feeling neglected and alone, with little relief from the mental health issues I was there to address.

Navos failed to provide the basic standard of humane care. I felt neglected, mistreated, and left in a worse state than when I arrived. It has taken months to recover from the trauma of my stay, and I would not recommend this facility to anyone seeking compassionate mental health care.",9/8/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Navos,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"I am reaching out regarding my constant request to have my son transferred to a healthy environment
Enabling him to leave the distressing experiences my son,
K, has been facing at Navos Inpatient Treatment
Facility.
K has reported several incidents of violence and
intimidation. He has endured people screaming at and around him,
witnessed physical altercations, and has even had a man threaten him
in a combative stance. These events have left him feeling
unsafe, and despite reporting them to the staff, he feels nothing is
being done to address his concerns. This constant exposure to violence
is severely damaging his sense of security and trust in the
treatment facility.

Additionally, he  has been experiencing hunger pains due to
dietary restrictions that were communicated to the facility upon his
admission. He cannot consume cheese or milk, yet the meals provided
often include these items or require milk, such as breakfast cereal.
While he has snacks, they are only available at certain times, leaving
him hungry when he cannot eat the provided meals or the meals are too
small to alleviate his hunger. He has also reported not receiving
dinner on several occasions and has had to wait for hours to get
water, even after multiple requests. This neglect is exacerbating his
physical and emotional distress, contributing to his deteriorating
health.

Visitation issues have further compounded our concerns. My mother and
I have been visiting him almost daily, but the half-hour visits
are insufficient. We have tried to schedule back-to-back visits, given
our over an hour commute, but have faced obstacles. On one occasion,
we were forced to return for a 4 pm visit despite a 2:30 pm slot being
available. Now, we are being told he can only have one half-hour visit per day, but even after asking we have not been shown
this policy in writing. Today when we came at 1:55 for our 30 minute visit, they had us waiting outside for 10 minutes into our 30 visit. Then 2:30 told us that we had to leave so another family could visit a patient. We never saw anyone else go in after us. The limitations to my sons support system are
causing him severe distress and isolation.

My son, who has been diagnosed with PTSD, has reported the staff
to be "" nice"" but he is suffering immensely due to the lack of care
and compassion in the policies at the facility. He has reported
breathing issues and a significant mental decline since his admission,
and he now needs assistance to make phone calls. Every call brings new
reports of distressing incidents or leaves him barely able to speak due to his deteriorating mental state.Today he reported a man screaming and banging his head against the wall in front of him. And another man lying in the floor in the center of the hall blocking his path. His PTSD symptoms are
intensifying in this hostile environment, where he feels constantly
threatened and unsupported.

My son was eagerly anticipating his court appearance on Monday,
July 22, to discuss his treatment plan and request a transfer to
Overlake, where he can receive the appropriate care. However, the
court date was postponed to the 29th without his genuine consent. He
is terrified of his current environment and the erratic behavior of
other patients. The delay in his court date prolongs his suffering and
places him at greater risk of further psychological harm.

My son  urgently needs to be transferred to a facility conducive to
his mental and emotional well-being. He cannot wait until the 29th.
Every moment he remains at Navos, he is at risk of further trauma.m

Cassandra wanted me to schedule another session clearly seeking nothing but monetary incentive so that she would get me an antidepressant prescription. Nothing about this experience was helpful, but knowing this isn't the right place.

Unfortunately pathology is extremely common in talk therapy and most talk therapists aren't suitable to treat traumatized people or listen to feelings.",1/9/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Pathlight Mood & Anxiety Center Seattle - Boren Ave.,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"Formally known as the Moore Center, partnered with Insight Behavioral Health Centers; which, was acquired by a private equity firm to identify as Eating Recovery Center and Pathlight Mood Anxiety Center; under, the Joint Commission. If you're wondering why you see drastic differences in reviews across locations, it's because they're all separate clinics. The RES treatment clinic (Moore Center) might have been amazing, but the PHP (Insight Behavioral Health) clinic they acquired to partner with has terrible communication between teams; and, forces that clinic to carve out another department for IOP out of budget; you, can see the problems start to add up. There could be multiple reasons. Look at the NPI, you will see the actual clinic(s) that are enslaved to the private equities joint commission; and, the doctors in charge of those clinics. In my opinion, I'd rather get treated by a good doctor (that knows what they're doing) than a clinic with a fancy logo.

If you're looking for treatment and you have a primary eating disorder with associated mood related disorders, this program will probably work for you. If your primary prognosis is depression, or have other neurological/developmental issues that present as textbook for their treatment protocol (for eating disorders); treatment, will actually be harmful for you. Please be careful.

I wouldn't say that my experience was negative, the staff treats you well; and, they are very welcoming. The environment is new, nothing is falling apart. There are not any issues of malpractice. The reason why my review is negative is because my treatment outcome was null, and I'm recommending to individuals like me to avoid this place.

Depending on what treatment level you get admitted in, you will have a different experience. You might step up or down to a different level, or discharge from your current level if you're stabilized. These treatment levels are technically different clinics/businesses, unless you get lucky and it's a top/down clinic. I would like to applaud the idea though because: in theory, it should offer better treatment outcomes. Unfortunately: due to horrid communication (at best) between teams and patient(s), patients are left confused about their treatment; and, worried about outcome; which, results in more anxiety. This can be a trigger for more problems, problems you're trying to treat. Ask as many questions as you can to the admissions team. It's your treatment, not theirs. Additionally, utilize the patient advocate. If they can't help you, contact the cooperate business office. You can file a grievance.

As an FYI, the patient advocate doesn't help you. All they do is put your complaints into a SHIRMIS-like (Safety and Health Information Risk Management Information System) and dump it out on a spreadsheet for the clinical manager to review Depending on how bad your complaint is, they might make a change so they won't get sued. If you're complaining about the water being a little warm that's coming out of the water fountain, they're not going to listen to that; for example. That would be like a 1 or a 2, if the risk management scale was from a 1-10 scale.

Overall, I personally think this is a great program for the narrow definition of disorders that they treat: Eating Disorders, Substance Abuse Disorders, and Trauma Disorders. That's it. If you have more complex issues, or other disorders that are actually the primary disorder; and have these Eating Disorders and alike as the secondary, they can't help you. I hope that this information helps you in selecting the right faculty in treating you for your mental health.
Regards,
Collin

Pathlight Mood & Anxiety Center Seattle - Boren Ave.,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"4 years ago, I was done. I had tried with all of my might for 37 years to ‚Äúfit‚Äù in to this world and I was completely defeated.

And instead of taking a drastic move, somehow my fingers were searching for help.I immediately called and had an immediate consultation with the sweetest lady. In a way she talked me down and saved my life. Pathlight is always there for you.

The program was terrifying at first, the idea of group sharing, and being so vulnerable. The first day I flipped out bc I couldn‚Äôt see my therapist. The staff were loving and understanding and did everything they could to comfort my mind.

Toby (love them) at the front desk even came and sat and Drew with me to bring me out of a panic attack.

I‚Äôm not gonna lie. This program is hard. You not only have/need to vent to a safe space, but the positive and supportive feedback you get is worth the discomfort. The hardest thing I had to learn was to STOP. We all jump to reaction and defense so quickly that our body goes haywire and we over react.

I learned self control, the importance of proper medication along with Trauma counseling‚Ä¶ I went every single day for 6 weeks- Our group became very close, however we all hugged and parted ways at the end because we had our own journeys to fare. But I did receive some notes of encouragement that I have pinned up to this day.

The thing I loved the most besides the amazing therapists and counselors is the isolation of it. You are with your group, you have blocks scheduled and you start to develop the need for that stability out in the world that you receive every day at Pathlight.

I continued trauma therapy with their recommended and suggested practice and found the best therapist who guided me along and gave me that stability that I craved from Pathlight Mood and Anxiety Center

When you complete the program (which they will assess how long is needed after 3-4 weeks. Some people stay a month and some longer.
They do have full hospitalization too- I encouraged a friend a year later )who couldn‚Äôt get past the immense loss of her husband),  and they transformed her life. , I was in the Partial Hospitalization Program or (PHP) where you drive to the location every day.

Things to know:
You will pay for parking but you can validate part of the cost by taking your ticket up to the desk to get the sticker before you leave.

It is DOWNTOWN Seattle- it‚Äôs up on a hill but literally part of the downtown exits - easy to miss.

If you live in Washington, there is a law and tax that people pay into to cover leave from work and this is covered by that law. I was paid 80% or something close of my wages and my job had to hold my spot when my filed for FMLA. So please know there are protections for you if you have to miss work.

It will change your life whether you want it to or not. These staff NEVER gives up on you. If you need to sit and cry, they offer a hug and a tissue. If you need to vent, they give you an office to scream. In fact, if you leave group, there are activity stations, yarn, coloring, sensory objects etc.

It‚Äôs a safe space, emotional support and therapist and counselor guided group sessions. There is a counselor leading every session so you are safe and protected no matter what.

And lastly - the food is really good. I think I made fun of 2 meals the entire time I was there. They are catered and you sit in the cute little kitchen/cafeteria.

‚ù§Ô∏èThank you dearly to the amazing staff and counselors and therapists and MD‚Äôs who care about their jobs and understand that they reach us through kindness, patience and compassion.

Pathlight Mood & Anxiety Center Seattle - Boren Ave.,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"This place is not well suited for kids with neuro diversity. Rather than being curious as to a behavior that may seem odd to the therapist they treated it as a miss behavior. I don't think it's ever wise for one to jump to conclusions. The therapist brought up their behavior concern to me clearly not being well trained in autism. I spoke with my child about it in detail to figure out why he was doing the behavior and so forth, which the therapists never did and realized that it was only a problem because Pathlight was embarrassed by the behavior and chose to punish it rather than understand.

Evidence Based Treatment Centers of Seattle,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"‚ÄúI want to strongly warn anyone considering EBTCS: this place is not going to help your family. That is not their goal. My experience, as well as what I‚Äôve heard from other mental health professionals, reveals that this organization is exploitative and manipulative. Some within the mental health community even describe it as a ‚Äòcult.‚Äô

Their use of behavioral modification felt more abusive than therapeutic, and their focus seemed to be on control rather than genuine care. Despite being referred to them for support, I was dismissed entirely when I disclosed my cannabis use, with no effort to address my situation.

They also exploited my family, assigning a very young and inexperienced therapist to work exclusively with my parents. This therapist wouldn‚Äôt communicate with me directly and appeared unprepared for the role, further highlighting the lack of professionalism at this facility.

If you are looking for meaningful help and ethical care, look elsewhere. There are far better providers who truly prioritize the well-being of individuals and families. Avoid EBTCS at all costs.",1/19/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Evidence Based Treatment Centers of Seattle,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"My child went through the school refusal program at EBTCS.    My biggest complaints are about the billing/cost and the effectiveness of the program.  They were not at all helpful in trying to work with my insurance company.  That was totally up to us to navigate and in the end was not covered.  During the treatment, the charges seemed arbitrary and capricious and at 6k/week we had to take out a 2nd mortgage to cover the cost (54k total). The therapists were certainly caring but the effects of the treatment were not long lasting.  In the end, my child found success by moving to a smaller school with a different format which is a program they should have known about and directed us to.   We found it on our own.  Instead, they wanted to blame us parents as to why my child was not succeeding. They succeeded only in putting my family in debt, enriching their lifestyles, and making us parents feel guilty.

Evidence Based Treatment Centers of Seattle,Seattle,mental health,healthcare,"My child did the Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) at EBTC in 2024. It was the program focused on DBT skills. The EBTC also has other programs such as exposure therapy IOP for anxiety and an eating disorder program. I can speak to the IOP focused on DBT. It was a positive life changing experience. I highly recommend it.

Outcomes: This program was life changing for my child. After the 8-week program, our child is lifted, skillful, and thriving. 4 months later our child continues to be skillful and continues to thrive. Our family was transformed by the program. My husband and I learned so much and are better parents, partners, and communicators. We considered the IOP at Thira Health. We decided on the EBTC because 1) we wanted a much smaller pool of kids, and we wanted our child to continue in school. This program is after school, so it was less disruptive 2) I was worried about contagion, so we opted for a smaller program with parental involvement. The program has very clear rules around not sharing details about target behavior, so our child never knew why other kids were in the program. They were all working on ‚Äútarget behaviors‚Äù and applying skills. 3) We wanted to be part of the program, which important for our child‚Äôs positive outcome. 4) We absolutely love the therapists. They are all very experienced and have a great rapport with teens 5) There is 24/7 support so depending on your child‚Äôs target behavior, this is critical and, in my opinion, the most important consideration in a program. 24/7 support means your child can talk to their therapist any time using skills in real time, coping ahead, etc. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. This is how the skills are used and become sticky because your child has support in crisis with the therapist.

Logistics: The IOP we did was based on DBT skills. My child had individual therapy 3 days a week for one hour followed by 2 hours of group DBT skills-based class with ourselves and other families (mix of parents, single parents, divorced parents, etc.). One day a week, the parents met together without kids and the kids met with another therapist during the skills-based portion of the program. The time commitment was 8 weeks, 3 days a week, 3 hours a day (1 hour for your kid‚Äôs individual therapy followed by 2 hours of group therapy). We dropped our kid off for the individual therapy and worked from the waiting room. There were between 1-3 other families doing the group therapy with us rolling in and out at different times. That worked out totally fine because it gave our child the opportunity to lead as new families came in and to see the progress and commitment from families who were near the end of the program when we joined. We used Spot Finder to find affordable monthly parking near the EBTC during the program. EBTC has different groups depending on the age of the child so that is also helpful from a peer group perspective. The parent group, once a week as part of the 3 day a week program was very helpful and offered a safe environment for parents to learn, share and grow.

Insurance: The program was covered by insurance (Cigna). There were several other families in the program with different insurance who also had it covered so check with your provider. When you call your insurance, ask is an IOP for mental health is covered and if it requires a referral. You will need the billing code from the EBTC and how much is billed for that code. Insurance companies will pay up to a certain amount for the billing code so check with your insurance provider. If the billed amount is over the max the insurance will pay for that billing code, that is 100% your responsibility, even if you meet your individual or family deductible. EBTC does not take insurance. They provide a weekly superbill that I submitted to insurance and then got reimbursed.",7/5/24,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Or told me to talk to my general therapist about it.

Hyland Behavioral Health Center,St Louis,mental health,healthcare,My daughter escaped there so say highly secured facility facility.  10 patients n 2 employees watching them while eating supper in the cafeteria. And my daughter disappeared.  Room mate had to tell them exactly what she was wearing. Cameras do not record according to 2 sources and that was told to the PD. Security guard was to present while patients in cafeteria and was not and no cameras in the back of the facility.  I filed a missing report. No one notified night shift nor emergency room night shift that my daughter escaped. According to 2 nurses 3 ways she could of escaped.

St. Louis Behavioral Medicine Institute (Macklind Office),St Louis,mental health,healthcare,"Wife was seeing Dr. Applewhite. Her last appointment was months ago, and was suddenly cancelled because she would not be available for an undetermined amount of time. When she could get an appointment, it was fine.

Since then, we haven't been able to get any contact through phone or email to get a prescription refill after multiple attempts and messages left in their automated system. All numbers lead to the same automated system. CVS has attempted to contact them for a refill with no luck as well. There is no option to even speak to a person for issues with prescriptions.

Our experience has echoed other reviews that this place is legitimately dangerous if you need help and consistent medication. We have no unpaid bills that I'm aware of. They are just incompetent and that makes them dangerous to people who need help.

I called a few days after my visit for a question about the medication prescribed, and was hung up on twice, the third time I was told rudely I‚Äôd get a call back which never came.

Do better, I don‚Äôt know how some of you sleep at night being so nasty to people who need help.

SSM Health Behavioral Health,St Louis,mental health,healthcare,"I was hospitalized here for 3 months straight in the behavioral health side. Im going to say this straight off the bat DO NOT COME HERE, DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILDREN HERE. Me and my peers were abused&neglected. 1: when i was hospitalized i was struggling with an anorexia (eating disorder) and for the whole 3 months i was hospitalized i didn‚Äôt eat. Instead i was mocked by staff, told i was choosing when i wanted to be sick on the days i was finally able to get out of bed because i was so weak and ill from being malnourished. It took them 3 months to decide to run tests on me where they then learned my organs were failing and i was dying only then i was finally transported to a real hospital called cardinalglennon where i recieved care for my eating disorder. 2: i was crying in my room and they offered me medication to take to calm me down at the time my ED made me struggle with taking medication as i was afraid i would gain weight so i declined i was then surrounded by 8 different staff as i begged them to just leave me alone and they all forcibly strapped me into a chair they then gave me 4 different shots of medication because i was still crying (over medicating me) and left me in a room alone for 9 hours straight when i left that chair i was left with 37 different bruises on my body. I reported it to my doctor and they didn‚Äôt take any photos of evidence or contact anyone outside the hospital. 3: my friends IUD had moved out of place inside of her causing her to be in extreme pain this day male staff was working so they ignored her cries for help and didn‚Äôt give her medication because ‚Äúthe conversation made them uncomfortable‚Äù 4: me and alot of other girls in the hospital were waiting for fostercare placements (thats why i was there for so long) we were told by staff that if we acted differently maybe we would have parents who loved us and we would have a home to stay in this same staff member also threatened to beat our ass and shoot us in our sleep (we were minors at this time) 6: the staff would refuse phonecalls for patients all the time for days on end not allowing us to have contact with the outside.

SSM Health Behavioral Health,St Louis,mental health,healthcare,"I have been admitted here four times so I definitely think I am qualified to right this review.  The first two time did not really seam that bad but I had never been to another hospital to know better.  The last two times I have been here my experience was just awful.  They did not change my medication at all on my third visit and just pushed electro convulsive therapy.  The last time I went they held me for four days before changing my medication but the doctor ordered a medicine that the pharmacy on site did not carry.  I ended up spending eight days locked in this hospital with no medication change and only received the new medicine when I was discharged.   Also while I was there on my last visit I tried to exercise some of my patients rights which where listed in a document I signed during my admission and they completely ignored them or just outright refused to allow me to exercise my rights.  The first right that was refused was my right to review my medical record which was just flat out denied by the nurses while I was in the hospital which I felt set me back since I could not study my record in order to have a more informed conversation with my doctor.  The next right that was refused was my right to transfer to another facility which was flat out denied for two days before I finally made any progress, but their solution was to have me personally contact a doctor at another hospital then to get that doctor to agree to take me.  Then to hope that that specific hospital had an open bed.  I was supposed to do this all without the help of the internet or a phone book since I was not allowed access to, and also while the phones we were allowed to use where turned off during a majority of the day because they do not allow phones to be on during group.  So basically the process of organizing your own transfer is impossible.  The last patient right that was violated was I asked to speak to a customer service representative and that was denied.  Several of the nurses were very rude, and there was no hot water for seven of the eight days I stayed at the hospital on my last visit.

Virginia Mason Medical Center,Seattle,specialty care,healthcare,"The care provided was excellent.
I am a family member of the patient. The accessibility and parking is horrible, typical of downtown Seattle. It would have been very helpful if the visitors parking were accessible. It was closed with no signage, so everyone had to make a U turn in a very tight entrance .
The cafeteria cook called in sick, there was no one to take his place so... no hot food. This is 100% a management failure. This means I had to leave the Buck parking and pay again. Then walk 2 blocks up a steep hill to enter the hospital through the only available entrance, emergency.
The cafeteria did not put up any signs that hot food was unavailable. I was told to come back at lunch time to ask for my $8 refund. Again 100% management failure.
If you get confused do NOT take the stairs. It will lock you in the stairwell.
No designated smoking area on campus. With only one way to access the building, leaving me with a choice, break the rules or walk 2 blocks away. A second entrance would solve that issue...... management....again.",2/22/25,4,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

I spent a total of 10 hours there‚Äîeight hours waiting for a CT scan and two additional hours before antibiotics were even administered.

Diverticulitis is chronic for me, and trips to the ER are, unfortunately, common for the same reason. But In my previous experiences at other ERs, a CT scan and the necessary treatment have rarely taken more than two or three hours. Ten hours is absolutely excessive and inexcusable. Because of this, I will not return to your facility, nor will I recommend it to anyone else.

I hope you will take immediate steps to address these systemic delays and improve patient care.

Fred Hutch Cancer Center,Seattle,specialty care,healthcare,"They provided good palliative (very generous with the narcotics) care for my wife's pancreatic cancer, but their cancer treatments were poor, insincere, and designed to for the patient to fit their program, not for the program to fit the patients needs.   Her treatments were initially once a week, with blood tests prior to the treatment.  On the second treatment for her second cycle, they found that her potassium levels were too low.   So they cancelled the treatment that week and gave her an intravenous infusion of potassium.  One of the things that her blood tests showed that week was that the ""cancer markers"" in her blood were lower than at any time since she started treatment.   At the time, I trusted the doc's decision.  We skipped that week and came back for the third treatment in that cycle, with a break then for imaging.   Her blood markers were never that low again.

After she died, I reviewed her medical tests, and asked why, instead of skipping the treatment, we didn't come back the next day (Saturday ) for the treatment.   Then they began fumbling around for further excuses, including that her white blood cell count was too low.  Upon further review, I noted that her white cell count had been worse before her first ever treatment.  Then they changed their story again that the cancer markers weren't all that important, and it was her imaging tests that showed that the tumors progressing.   They seemed to be basing this on the imaging that was still 2 weeks in the future.   After the third treatment in cycle 2, and the break for the imaging, the doctor proposed changing her chemo to a much, MUCH more toxic bunch of chemicals.   She was only able to take 2 rounds of that treatment, and the pictures I have show how fast she deteriorated, and she died a month after starting the ""new and better"" chemo.

She chose to stop the treatments after the second time, preferring to face the agony of the disease to the misery of ""medical treatment"".

When I challenged them about skipping the second treatment, instead of rescheduling it the next day (which would have been on a Saturday.   For the record, that clinic on a Saturday is like a high school campus.), they gave me a variety of run arounds, but never a straight answer.

When I experience media ads for assorted cancer treatment facilities, I can only weep, and wish I had paid attention to them in time.

Specifically, the GI doctor, Dr. Batar, lacked empathy when recommending an NG tube and also told us that if we were to seek a second opinion, any other doctor would say the same thing. We were not against a feeding tube, but adamant in exploring all other options before going that route. It was also notable that Dr. Batar asked us if our son has reflux, to which I replied he does not spit up but it‚Äôs possible he has silent reflux. That was quickly dismissed as a nonissue but a couple weeks later a private practice OT who I sought out did a feeding evaluation and within minutes she saw all the telltale signs of silent reflux. We ended up at Seattle Children‚Äôs ER because of silent reflux and our baby‚Äôs refusal to eat/pain when eating. When following up, Dr. Batar sounded skeptical that silent reflux exists, even though we saw drastic improvement after starting reflux medication from the ER visit. At best he is rather rude, at worst, I would deem his ‚Äúcare‚Äù negligent and dismissive.

Aside from Dr. Batar, we saw a dietitian who basically just had us fortify our son‚Äôs milk to a pretty extreme level that caused dehydration. We also saw a speech and language pathologist who had little to no useful feedback. And an OT who spent 5-10 minutes with him per session and didn‚Äôt give much support other than advising us to increase tummy time.

We did seek a second opinion at Seattle Children‚Äôs and the team we now have in place is empathetic, compassionate, and competent. They have tried a few new approaches (e.g. taking him off fortified milk to see if he would take more volume, exploring a bottle aversion as a cause, increasing his reflux dose, using an appetite stimulant, and ordering a swallow study) that weren‚Äôt mentioned or presented to us as options at Swedish and we are finally finding answers and seeing progress. If an NG tube is needed in the future, I now have confidence that we have exhausted all other options.

I felt Swedish wanted to put a bandaid over the issue and get him to gain weight with a feeding tube just to mark it as a success. It didn‚Äôt seem they were open to discovering the root cause of why our son was self-limiting the volume of milk he was drinking. As it turns out, he has been silently aspirating every time he ate. We never would have discovered this without a swallow study and it was never once presented as an option.

If you‚Äôre looking for pediatric care for your child, I highly recommend going to Seattle Children‚Äôs Hospital and not wasting your time with Swedish. We spent three months spinning our wheels with Swedish and it‚Äôs been night and day working with the SCH team.",8/23/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Swedish Pediatric Specialty Care - Seattle,Seattle,specialty care,healthcare,"My son's pediatrician recommended for him to do the Metabolic Health Program because he was diagnosed with childhood obesity. His blood sugar and cholesterol are both BORDERLINE. I decided to continue on with the appointment even if my son has started an improved and effective diet, thinking that I'll learn something new. Our first appointment was with an endocrinologist, Dr. Swetha Sriram. She recommended that my son start taking Metformin! She even said she gives it to babies, to try to convince us to agree with it. She looked definitely young, a new inexperienced doctor. My son has been to 3 doctors after this blood test and not one mentioned metformin! Needless to say, we won't be back. I guess this program is about giving kids more medicines, regardless of age. My son is already on his way to weight loss and will prove this doctor wrong with his normal sugar and cholesterol levels in a few months.

My wife noticed a lump on my neck that she wanted to check out.  They gave me an appointment at 9:30 am with Dr Alice Jiang.  I had to get my 11 month old to Daycare so getting out the house is challenging.  I fought rush hour traffic and the construction around their facility to pull into garage at 9:44. Probably got to desk 9:47.   Dr Jiang refused to see me and they kept citing their policy is 15 minutes.  Never mind that the appointment is 30 minutes so my time was until 10 and the doctor could have easily checked the lump and kicked me out at 10.  Certainly would have been better than refusing to see me.

This is a heartless facility and you are a cog in their machine.  It is difficult to get to and they care more about being on time than your health.  I‚Äôm pretty sure that the Dr has discretion to see you if they want although the facility will fall on the sword for the Dr and cite their policy of over 10 years.

2. After my exam, I was asked to wait in the seating area for another specialist (no reason was disclosed). After waiting about 15 minutes, the gal that came out purely wanted to upsell me on frames.

Diverticulitis is chronic for me, and trips to the ER are, unfortunately, common for the same reason.

I have tried everything from acupuncture, cortisone injections, hot/cold patches and other natural therapies. I was in the process of making an appointment for knee surgery when my mother‚Äôs friend had tried stem cell procedure at Pinnacle Integrated Health. I was hesitant to go because stem cell is considered an alternative medicine and some are speculative about the therapy but it has been nothing but a blessing to take this chance not just on Pinnacle Integrative Health‚Äôs awesome team but on myself. The alternative was to do the traditional knee surgery and will not be able to move and care for my young children and I just wasn‚Äôt there yet.

Six months later, I have lost 40 pounds and still losing. I can go up/down the stairs without pain, I sleep better at night and couldn‚Äôt be happier. It was the best decision I have ever made. I humbly thank the team because it has truly improved my quality of life.

If you are hesitant, I would say to just go and learn about the process. There is nothing to lose by just learning about the options that you have other than the evasive traditional knee surgery. I‚Äôm not saying that by just getting the stem cell therapy that itself is all you need. No, you will need to change your mindset about your lifestyle- you will need to change your diet and add exercise to your daily regimen and see your transformation. Trust in yourself and you‚Äôll be happier/ healthier in the end!",1/22/25,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Pinnacle Integrative Health,Seattle,specialty care,healthcare,"I'm 59. I've been riding dirtbikes for 49 years. Because of what I've done the majority of my life I've suffered more injuries than I can count. 4 years ago I crashed off the side of a mountain and injured my shoulder. Over the last 4 years it got worse and worse. The medical treatment? Take anti-inflamatories and when it gets bad enough, we'll do surgery. Not a good outlook. In September of this year it was so bad I couldn't lift a bag of groceries out of my car. I tried to skip a rock at the lake and the shot of pain dropped me to my knees. I would wake up several times at night because of the pain. I was desperate. I had been searching on Google for what I could do and thru the magic of targeted advertising based on searches, an ad popped up on my Facebook for Pinnacle Integrative Health. Come in and get screened for 35 dollars to see if they could help. I figured what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I went in and they examined my shoulder and said they could help. They would inject stem cells, prp, and ozone therapies into my shoulder. I'd have acupuncture. And for it to all work, I'd have to change what I ate. I knew pro athletes did these treatments so I thought, what do I have to lose. At this point I was in constant pain. I had maybe 10% use of my right arm. My muscles in my arm were shrinking from not being able to use it. So I went for it. I was scheduled for 5 treatments. By the 3rd treatment I had 50% use of my arm. The constant pain was gone. I still had pain with some movements but it was greatly reduced. By the final treatment I had 80% use and what pain I had with movement was a slight annoyance not crippling pain. As I write this, I am 3 weeks into follow on physical therapy and have nearly full use of my arm and am virtually pain free. My physical therapist is amazed at the progress I make between appointments, especially for someone my age. But back to Pinnacle. During my visits I worked with every member of the staff. Tam, behind the desk was friendly and attentive. His communication about appointments and reminders was outstanding. Maria and Jared handled the injections, which can be painful. That being said, the only pain was from the injections themselves, not from hitting something they weren't supposed to. Their expertise made the injections as pain free as possible given the nature of the injections. Not to mention they were friendly and proffesional. Not forced friendly, but genuinely friendly and personable. Really that could be said for every member of the staff. Daniel did the accupuncture. Never had that before, but it was pain free and really relaxing. Oliver handled the Financials he was friendly and listened to my concerns. He presented many easy financial options and explained everything that would be involved. I only officially saw him the first visit, but I would see him and he always stopped and asked me how I was doing, if I was feeling any better. The entire staff was friendly and genuinely cared how I was doing. Not once did a single member on staff walk by without saying hi and asking me how I was. I actually enjoyed my time there. So if you read all the way down here, I'd just like to say, I don't do reviews. My shoulder was toast. I didn't think I'd be able to ride again. I thought I was doomed to deal with this pain the rest of my life. Pinnacle delivered in every aspect. Easy to deal with, professional, genuinely friendly, competent, and they actually did it! They fixed my shoulder.  In a few weeks I'll be cleared to ride again, something I thought I was going to lose forever.  I cannot thank Pinnacle enough for giving me my life back. There are not words strong enough to say what it means to me to be able to continue doing what I love. As I said, I don't do reviews, but I had to say something. I cannot repay the gift they have given me. Seriously. Thank you Daniel, Maria, Jared, Oliver, and Tam. Maybe my results aren't typical, but what have you got to lose.  And yes, I'm real. This was my experience.",12/14/24,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

When I informed the doctor of the pain that I was feeling I was Told twice no talking and to be quiet.   He seemed to Have no compassion regarding My pain.  I was under the impression that I would be given a local anesthetic before the procedure started to my knowledge, this was not the case.  This was the most horrific thirty minutes of my life.  I don't even think I waited for the mandatory observation.  I immediately walked back to the intake room put on my shirt and left.  I really did not wish to see this doctor again.  However on the third day sends this procedure the pain was really kicking it up.   So I made another appointment with him and it was a complete disaster.   I was chewed out for a message that I put on my chart regarding his behavior toward me.   This doctor then proceeds to gaslate me and humiliate me in every shape and form.   He told me that I didn't have what I had been diagnosed with back in march.  He told me I had something completely different.  He explained then that there was a couple of other injections that could be performed. And when I told him that I couldn't do any more injection unless I was completely sedated. He rolled his eye.  So finally, after twenty minutes of his gaslighting humiliation, I had decided I'd had enough and this appointment was over.  He then proceeds to hand a sheet of paper with quote pain clinics listed.  So this morning August twenty ninth I Called several of several of them.

***Of all the nurses, respiratory therapists, charge nurses, and CNAs that treated my husband, 14 of them provided the highest level of care. They treated my husband like he was part of their family and not just a patient. They went above and beyond in what was expected of them taking care of the ‚Äúlittle things.‚Äù  They were kind and attentive. It was obvious these people have very high standards in the care they provide to their patients. They communicated well and followed through on addressing the concerns I voiced when my husband could not advocate for himself
*** In addition to the 14 exceptional people that stood out, there were 8-10 very good people on staff who treated my husband with compassion and provided very good care.

CONS:
***Lack of communication from many staff members regarding treatment
***Staff unable to reach on call physician first night we were there regarding my husband‚Äôs medication
***Did not see housekeeping once in the two weeks we were there
***Visible dirt on floors throughout entire stay
***Some staff members were very condescending, showed obvious irritation, and were dismissive when there was an issue regarding quality of care being given
***Respiratory therapist dropped my husband‚Äôs speaking valve on the dirty floor and was going to use it on him until I told her absolutely not
***I had to ask for a speech therapist, two RNs, and a respiratory therapist to be ‚Äúbanned‚Äù from treating my husband due to concerns regarding the quality of care being given to my husband.
I should not have to ‚Äúban‚Äù 4 people in a two week stay for unacceptable attitude and care provided or safety concerns
***Upon arrival the TV remote was on the floor and covered in dried brown sticky substance. It was cleaned and then shown not to work. It was fixed the next day but this is unacceptable when it is the only distraction for someone lying in a hospital bed
***Used call light with no response after 20 minutes. I was told by the nurse and CNA that ‚Äúwe have bad reception‚Äù and ‚Äúour phone didn't go off‚Äù. Again, unacceptable excuses
***Some staff members are unclear on protocols and/or do not follow directions from their superiors regarding contacting the on-call physician

I understand every hospital has ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù care given by staff but the ‚Äúbad‚Äù care given should not be almost equal to the ‚Äúgood‚Äù care provided. It should be the exception.
I also understand this is a hospital and you cannot predict what will happen from one minute to the next. However when you have a legitimate reason for a medicine to be given at a certain time and four other people including two of your superiors agree then that request should be honored and not ignored.
My husband did receive good care during our stay but I had to advocate, intervene, and complain more times than I could count in order for him to receive that care.",8/1/24,3,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Select Specialty Hospital - Town and Country,St Louis,specialty care,healthcare,"They almost killed my son repeatedly, they accused us of bringing meth to my son in select services,  there is no treatment just abuse by the staff, they even stole his pain medication.

My son left early and had vacomicin leaking out his arm with blood under the IV tape. They didn't even change his bandage, not once tIll his last days, the bandage was rotten flesh smell.

Major lawsuit is coming, and anyone is welcomed to join us. We have 2 victims ready to sue.

This place is a tragedy that will not care for your loved ones. Staff threatens to hit patients, staff is downright ignorance.

When my son called for help it never came, when he'd look for help they'd  be on their cell phones, could you imagine begging for water for days and never get that water.

We are moving forward with a lawsuit,      the accusation of us bringing my son meth was from a suspicious false positive drug test  no other drugs, including THC was not found.

Do not let anyone go to select hospital,  I was warned from my buddy not to bring him there, they killed his dad from a simple clear an artery operation.

They picked him apart down to one lung. They gave him a MRSA blood infection and pneumonia.

Look at the other reviews of how this place kills people.

It's time to sue in a class action lawsuit. And it's coming for what they did to my son and my buddy's Dad.

Stay far away from select hospital.
They almost killed my son within 2 days after surgery, they abused us calling us liars, saying it was apnea, it was 15 mg of oxycodone every 3 hours that did it. Look at that dose.

Exactlly what we said was causing it, not apnea, that mistake put him back in ICU

That was missouri baptist , the only good thing was the surgeon. Everything else was abusive and deadly.

In court we will be vidicated.

Forgot to mention his cards and money was stolen by the staff, what we gave him was stolen and never returned. We drone 2 hours promised if will filled out paperwork with my son, we would have an online helth chart to monitor our sons progress.

They never provided to my son our us.
That was my loved one, we wanted his healthcare information. How dare them not provide it for double heart valve replacement with a MRSA blood infection as well, then have to leave a week early during treatment.

Do not take your loved ones to select hospital or missouri baptist aftercare.
You will risk losing them under thier care.",5/24/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

St Louis Pain Consultants - Creve Coeur,St Louis,specialty care,healthcare,"This is a fantastic office. I've had 6 total surgeries on my thumb and forefinger over the last 18 months including a complete fusion. I had been a patient of a pain management  Dr at BJC for 2 years during my surgeries. I was unhappy with then (they stopped listening, didn't offer any options other than narcotics, and,  when I brought up concerns over withdrawals, they completely dismissed me). I officially left their practice because my surgeon was willing to provide pain medication during recovery of my last surgery. I was optimistically naive in thinking I wouldn't be in pain afterward even though my surgeon had told me I would still be in significant pain. I went to a pain management in Belleville first. She got me mixed up with a other patient several times and answered 2 personal phone calls during our appointment. I was ready to just give up and had decided I'd just be in pain forever and would go through withdrawals on my own. On a whim I called this office. I'm beyond happy I did. The office staff is friendly and Mark is absolutely fantastic.  I walked out of my first appointment with a plan that will hopefully replace pain medication along with a plan to taper me off the pain medication. I feel like I finally found a pain management Dr and PA that actually listened to me and my concerns. I highly recommend this office :)",9/15/24,5,POSITIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Not my dr.?  But it was her assistant.  I had requested a dr appt. My MRI was no longer in chart and it was not retrieved.   I was never informed of the process that my future appts were not always with the dr.  My goal was to find out definitelythe source of my back. I even had the spit marked by the PT. I was referred by another dr. but did not know it was a pain management facility and so I was sent back  to the physical therapist who did help me.  As time passed, my intense pain had passed unless i moved wrong.  I was encouraged to get injections I didnt feel I needed.  I expressed 1st visit I had an MRI AND CT SCAN of my back but it was not where my pain originated or where it was. I still have not gotten another image of this area.  After multiple months the dr discovered the area but no further images were ordered.  I asked and expressed wanting to know what is wrong with back.  No difinitive conclusions or further testing was ordered. This was my purpose my original and following two visits.  I want to see the dr and be told what is the cause of my pain.  After requesting further information I was told to make another appt.  So after 3 primary appts and 3 appts with an ortho dr, I still do not know the state of my back that still causes me issues.  Im tired of being given pills or offered pain injections, paying numerous copays for visits and images thru an ER or a 3rd dr. After 11 months I still have no answers and the drs told me as much.

The medication would help temporarily, but after a week or so back to the normal. Since I have been a patient of Dr.Padda‚Äôs I have been getting better with my pain being managed. The team here at Dr.Padda‚Äôs office actually creates a medical plan tailored too your areas of pain, scale of pain, and the length you have been in pain. The process of getting into become his patient is very easy, and the front desk clerk makes sure you get all the information needed to come prepared for your next appointment. Dr.Padda also does not just give you pain medications to mask the pain. A mix of different treatment types are combined together to create a treatment plan as I mentioned above tailored directly to the needs of each patient differently.",10/2/24,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

One Medical,Seattle,telehealth,healthcare,"Yelp deleted this. Wonder if they got financial assistance to do that.

Truly pathetic some of the loops they are trying to run people through. They literally added ""pathetic"" to their feedback grid. That is larva level. Add ""larva level"" as well.

They're asking me to leave a review saying Proton Mail isn't a real email. But yet somehow Google is. Wonder why that might be. Compromisability?

I was actually impressed to begin with. They had a lot of providers at the ready and a good matching system. They had very expedient care coordination. I actually thought it was pretty good for just a second. I was willing to try it. But of course. Almost complete failure, though they had very good internal work. Very organized and attractive and clean inside, that part they did a very good job with. When I came in they actively were telling me to get a humidifier when I came in for a black mold concern. When it wasn't that, it was concerns that I should buy a saline product for a bleeding nose. Of course, guess what's on the shelf. A new, brand new, saline product. That's disgusting. That shows how libertarianism cannot intersect with good medical care. In addition, the whole thing seemed to be run by someone with a coke problem. Everything suggested someone with a coke problem. If you're a doctor and have a coke problem, that's one thing, but projecting it on other people is sincerely just pathetic. Just get help for your own coke problem. There also looked like weird surveillance structures that they didn't inform or give consent to. Finally, they didn't have a good understanding about how humidity affected mold, suggesting a humidifer for a black mold problem. When in fact I had moved in an old discarded fan because it increases circulation reducing the likelihood of black mold but then they did a check and randomly said you can't have two fans. That seems absoutely bizarre. Then the One Medical recommendation's was to have a humidifier. That seems like straight up malpractice and opportunist diagnosis to get a product sold while struggling so badly with coke that it's invading their practice.

Finally their care summary had next to nothing on it like they didn't want information recorded and they didn't even specify that some of the symptoms suggested a concerning issue that would have been the OBVIOUS diagnostic cause of my headache. Instead they tried to say it was the weather outside and to put lemon in my water. Truly, truly embarrassing work. Evil or just bad, it doesn't matter. Just a massive embarrassment.

I really thought they might have been able to do it with One Medical. I was open. Of course, they used it to sell a new product that had just hit the shelves.

I didn't have the location in Downtown Seattle. I had it at a different location. I was really hopeful that they could do a good job. I really thought maybe they could have what it takes. They didn't. They couldn't. It was all narcissistic rage again. Such a disappointment.",11/15/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

SSM Health Telehealth Services,St Louis,telehealth,healthcare,"From the website there is a leave no patient alone policy. This is in addition to the Missouri  law that allows a patient to have someone with them while receiving care. The er violated this law multiple times. My daughter was in a car accident and taken there. Repeatedly, they tried to keep me from being with her when seeing a Dr. They intentionally place them where there is only one chair . I sat on the floor becsuse she was crying and I didnt want to leaver her alone in a hallway.
They finally put a brace on her neck and took the ct. We waited for thr results and when it was time to take her back, they refused to allow me, her mother to go with her. She had a head injury and pain was at an 8 but they didnt think an additional coherent person was necessary for her to make medical decisions. After trying to explain that, Victoria in the ER still refused to allow it . They intentionally make people wait longer if they want someone to go with them. So my daughter agreed to go back by herself. Victoria then decided to prove a point and rather than take her back to talk to the dr,  she by passed my daughter to leave her in pain and prolong her suffering. She began calling other patients and left my daughter. In the midst of that , Victoria did it to another patient as well. A woman had a autisic adult child and they refused to let her go back to talk to the dr with him. She only asked do we have power of attorney and we both did and the patient right there requesting, but she refused both of them. We asked for an administrator and they refused to get one.  We told them it was a violation of their patient rights and then they made us go outside altogether. After another hour of wating outside,  I saw through the window that my daughter still had not been seen and her phone had died so she had no way of reaching me.  So I went back in to get her so we could go to another hospital. Upon going back in, I see another patient just laid out on the floor at the emergency room entrance and no one was attending to him. They were walking by causually as if nothing was unusual. I have images of the person who was on the floor and Victoria standing at the door calling in other patients to go in front of my daughter after she had called my daughter to go back. She  willfully and intentionally neglected her care and  left her to suffer longer and wait to prove a point . So much so that we left to go to another hospital for care. The other image of Victoria is her refusing the mother who wanted to accompany her autistic so . The one in the window is who refused to get an administrator and asserted she was qualified to help.

I started vomiting and getting hot and weak, so I told her to come in to help me.  Once she came in, I began feeling better.  She started assisting some of the elderly patients there, who had been sitting for hours.  To not allow at least one loved one in the emergency room with a patient is showing lack of compassion.

Rezilient Health - Clayton Clinic,St Louis,telehealth,healthcare,"It's a little weird at first because it‚Äôs a hybrid model of healthcare, but overall I like it! It does take some getting used to. The best part is the healthcare practitioner being on-time because they are not overbooked with patients....The practitioner is in the visit the entire time and not trying to see multiple patients at once.

Edited as of Oct 29: They are switching to a subscription model where they are no longer taking insurance and the fee is $100 a month which is $1200 a year. The average person doesn‚Äôt visit their PCP enough to justify that sort of cost.

I went in there with a rash on my face seeking help. The doctor that saw me spoke to me like a child, refused to recommend ointments or creams, just prescribed an antibiotic. Chastising me because I was drinking an energy drink. I don't appreciate being talked to in that manner especially because it cost money I really couldn't afford at the time
And she didn't stop there. She wrote all that crap on the paperwork that I needed to show my employer. I went there for a severe rash on my face, im aware my blood pressure is high. To me personally she needs to be reviewed by her employer. Her name is Laurie Heaps. After reading some of the other reviews I wish I would of took the time to read them. Atleast I'm not the only one that had experiences like this. I was doing my best to control my temper with her from the time She walked in. I felt she was acting unprofessional and I am a customer and she got paid to act the way she did. Avoid this place like the Plague.",7/17/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

UW Medicine Urgent Care,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"This review is for the receptionist on duty not for the care received which was outstanding. I took my daughter in for urgent care on a Saturday morning. Waited in total about 90 mins which wasn‚Äôt too bad. But during that time I witnessed the receptionist  be so rude to several people. One girl was feeling faint as she‚Äôd mixed some medications. She told her she couldn‚Äôt help & needed to go to the ER. No help with where that might be so I asked the gal if she needed help or directions. Another elderly lady said she was hard of hearing & if she wore a mask & stayed behind the glass screen would the receptionist mind lowering her mask so she‚Äôd be able to lip read. The receptionist refused saying she didn‚Äôt lower her mask for anyone. Proceeded to shout at the lady who was so confused she thought she had to wait 3 days to get seen. Another gal came in pregnant with possible bleeding & was told without any kind of compassion she wouldn‚Äôt be able to get help there & needed to go to the ER. The receptionist lacks any kind of customer care skills and should really not be working this kind of job.
As I said the rest of the care & the other receptionist who was just filling in for the day, were outstanding. Just having to witness someone be so unkind and thoughtless when people are coming in for care is unacceptable.",2/9/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
UW Medicine Urgent Care,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"I have been in 2x in the last week for an unknown problem with my lip (I was prescribed a short period of steroids to try to calm it down, and antibiotics just in case) and the gal that checked me in (Serena - sorry if that's spelled wrong) was very polite and nice. I had woken up very early to go online to ""hold my spot"" for a preferred time so I didn't have to wait ages (my favorite thing this clinic offers - I find my preferred time and select it, then go in at the saved time and I'm usually the next one on the list to be seen).

Dr McKenzie (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong) was great and came in briefly to say she was seeing another patient right now but would be in as soon as she could. That was nice. About 20 mins later she came in and examined my lip again but she thinks with the med course I'm on, and that with the improvement I've had since I originally came in it should resolve on its own. I trust her opinion and she was very reassuring and respected my fears of it being something worse than a canker sore.

All in all, a very good experience and will happily go there for urgent care in the future.",3/2/25,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
UW Medicine Urgent Care,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"The rating is not for the providers at this location, who I have only had pleasant and very helpful interactions with. They‚Äôve always helped me and made sure all my issues are addressed.

This rating is for the reception staff. I was here earlier today and witnessed the rudest‚Äîfrankly cruel‚Äîtreatment of people I‚Äôve ever seen in a health care facility. The female receptionist was so rude to a patient that they literally broke down into tears. Her coworker had to take a moment to pull the patient aside to talk to them in the waiting area because the female receptionist continued to be rude and yell at her across the waiting room. It made my miserable health issue even more miserable.

This receptionist was briefly rude to me but thankfully she didn‚Äôt make me cry. I was waiting for a while and witnessed her cut people off while they were speaking, yell at them to stand in specific places to be helped, and complain about the energy of the waiting room.

I unfortunately have chronic health issues that lead me to seeking treatment at urgent care frequently. After this experience today I will not be coming back to this location, even though it is the closest urgent care and is the most convenient location for me to go. I don‚Äôt want to risk seeing this receptionist yell at another patient.

Total Access Urgent Care,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"The following is a summary of my experience yesterday after experiencing several days  of flu/cold issues.
I got an appointment for 2:10 but was not taken to an exam room until almost 3 pm.  When I first arrived, no one acknowledged my presence which was disappointing.The black clerk finally got off the computer and checked me in but did an incomplete job.  She didn‚Äôt even notice I had no insurance in the system until later.  While waiting, I asked what happened to the TV watching.  The two clerks told me Urgent Care decided to cancel it.

When I got to the exam room, I was seen by an EMT who was terrific.  She communicated clearly unlike the PA I saw soon after.  While awaiting for the lab results, I saw a remote control on the counter and, big surprise, the TV turned on!

The PA was impatient that I could not understand her questions behind her mask.  I felt like I was being interrogated and my answers were being questioned.  She said I should return in a few days if I didn‚Äôt get better. I asked about a prescription decongestant or something similar.  I‚Äôd gotten something like this before and it really helped.  She Categorically said no waving her hands around the room to indicate there was nothing to be done and the visit was over.

So, in the interest of being transparent, in my career I have worked in urgent care both in the lab, assisting the PA/NPs and later managing the unit.  I understand that it was a miserable day weather-wise and no one likes working weekends - so don‚Äôt be there if you can‚Äôt be more supportive and professional.  My experience left me going home frustrated and no better off than when I walked in.

In closing, I am hoping someone from this organization reads this and addresses the problem.  There are several  places to receive urgent care.  This is not the only one.  TY!",2/18/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

My only complaint is that on 12/31/23 I walked in and was told that they were at capacity and I needed to reserve a time online. I don't go to urgent care a ton, but every time that I've been to one it was always walk-in rather than by an appointment.

The nurse practitioner who saw me looked at my ear without cleaning the liquid that built up due to the infection and told me that it was simply an external ear infection and prescribed ear drops to fix the problem.

Upon returning home it turned out that I had a perforated eardrum and that the ear drops were utterly ineffective. The nurse would've seen this had she actually taken the time to clean the ear and look carefully.

After our initial visit to another urgent care facility, we were left feeling anxious and uncertain about her condition. Despite the urgent care's oversight, John was thorough and attentive during our appointment. He took the time to listen to our concerns and performed a comprehensive examination.

It was clear from the start that John was dedicated to getting to the bottom of Emma's illness. He quickly recognized the symptoms that were overlooked previously and ordered the necessary tests that ultimately confirmed pneumonia. His swift action not only led to a proper diagnosis but also ensured that Emma received the right treatment without delay.

What truly stood out about John was his compassionate approach. He took the time to explain everything to us in a way that was easy to understand, easing our worries as parents. He also provided us with valuable information on how to support Emma‚Äôs recovery at home, which made a significant difference.

Thanks to John's expertise and caring nature, Emma is now on the mend and returning to her joyful self.

The test came back negative, which was reassuring.  I also felt reassured because she was able to see that my ears looked clear and flying wouldn't be an issue.  She also gave me a soothing steroid mouth wash that helped relieve the inflammation.  I had never been offered a steroid mouthwash for quick relief and it worked well.

From there, it was an absolute breeze! I was completely out with all information inside of an hour. Everyone I worked with was incredibly efficient and really nice.

UW Medicine Urgent Care at Ballard,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"This review is for the receptionist on duty not for the care received which was outstanding. I took my daughter in for urgent care on a Saturday morning. Waited in total about 90 mins which wasn‚Äôt too bad. But during that time I witnessed the receptionist  be so rude to several people. One girl was feeling faint as she‚Äôd mixed some medications. She told her she couldn‚Äôt help & needed to go to the ER. No help with where that might be so I asked the gal if she needed help or directions. Another elderly lady said she was hard of hearing & if she wore a mask & stayed behind the glass screen would the receptionist mind lowering her mask so she‚Äôd be able to lip read. The receptionist refused saying she didn‚Äôt lower her mask for anyone. Proceeded to shout at the lady who was so confused she thought she had to wait 3 days to get seen. Another gal came in pregnant with possible bleeding & was told without any kind of compassion she wouldn‚Äôt be able to get help there & needed to go to the ER. The receptionist lacks any kind of customer care skills and should really not be working this kind of job.
As I said the rest of the care & the other receptionist who was just filling in for the day, were outstanding. Just having to witness someone be so unkind and thoughtless when people are coming in for care is unacceptable.",2/9/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
UW Medicine Urgent Care at Ballard,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"I have been in 2x in the last week for an unknown problem with my lip (I was prescribed a short period of steroids to try to calm it down, and antibiotics just in case) and the gal that checked me in (Serena - sorry if that's spelled wrong) was very polite and nice. I had woken up very early to go online to ""hold my spot"" for a preferred time so I didn't have to wait ages (my favorite thing this clinic offers - I find my preferred time and select it, then go in at the saved time and I'm usually the next one on the list to be seen).

Dr McKenzie (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong) was great and came in briefly to say she was seeing another patient right now but would be in as soon as she could. That was nice. About 20 mins later she came in and examined my lip again but she thinks with the med course I'm on, and that with the improvement I've had since I originally came in it should resolve on its own. I trust her opinion and she was very reassuring and respected my fears of it being something worse than a canker sore.

All in all, a very good experience and will happily go there for urgent care in the future.",3/2/25,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
UW Medicine Urgent Care at Ballard,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"The rating is not for the providers at this location, who I have only had pleasant and very helpful interactions with. They‚Äôve always helped me and made sure all my issues are addressed.

This rating is for the reception staff. I was here earlier today and witnessed the rudest‚Äîfrankly cruel‚Äîtreatment of people I‚Äôve ever seen in a health care facility. The female receptionist was so rude to a patient that they literally broke down into tears. Her coworker had to take a moment to pull the patient aside to talk to them in the waiting area because the female receptionist continued to be rude and yell at her across the waiting room. It made my miserable health issue even more miserable.

This receptionist was briefly rude to me but thankfully she didn‚Äôt make me cry. I was waiting for a while and witnessed her cut people off while they were speaking, yell at them to stand in specific places to be helped, and complain about the energy of the waiting room.

I unfortunately have chronic health issues that lead me to seeking treatment at urgent care frequently. After this experience today I will not be coming back to this location, even though it is the closest urgent care and is the most convenient location for me to go. I don‚Äôt want to risk seeing this receptionist yell at another patient.

I will also be reaching out to patient relations to complain on Monday.",1/12/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

When it wasn't that, it was concerns that I should buy a saline product for a bleeding nose. Of course, guess what's on the shelf. A new, brand new, saline product. That's disgusting. That shows how libertarianism cannot intersect with good medical care. In addition, the whole thing seemed to be run by someone with a coke problem. Everything suggested someone with a coke problem. If you're a doctor and have a coke problem, that's one thing, but projecting it on other people is sincerely just pathetic. Just get help for your own coke problem. There also looked like weird surveillance structures that they didn't inform or give consent to. Finally, they didn't have a good understanding about how humidity affected mold, suggesting a humidifer for a black mold problem. When in fact I had moved in an old discarded fan because it increases circulation reducing the likelihood of black mold but then they did a check and randomly said you can't have two fans. That seems absoutely bizarre. Then the One Medical recommendation's was to have a humidifier. That seems like straight up malpractice and opportunist diagnosis to get a product sold while struggling so badly with coke that it's invading their practice.

Finally their care summary had next to nothing on it like they didn't want information recorded and they didn't even specify that some of the symptoms suggested a concerning issue that would have been the OBVIOUS diagnostic cause of my headache. Instead they tried to say it was the weather outside and to put lemon in my water. Truly, truly embarrassing work. Evil or just bad, it doesn't matter. Just a massive embarrassment.

I really thought they might have been able to do it with One Medical. I was open. Of course, they used it to sell a new product that had just hit the shelves.

I didn't have the location in Downtown Seattle. I had it at a different location. I was really hopeful that they could do a good job. I really thought maybe they could have what it takes.

I took my daughter in for urgent care on a Saturday morning. Waited in total about 90 mins which wasn‚Äôt too bad. But during that time I witnessed the receptionist  be so rude to several people. One girl was feeling faint as she‚Äôd mixed some medications. She told her she couldn‚Äôt help & needed to go to the ER. No help with where that might be so I asked the gal if she needed help or directions. Another elderly lady said she was hard of hearing & if she wore a mask & stayed behind the glass screen would the receptionist mind lowering her mask so she‚Äôd be able to lip read. The receptionist refused saying she didn‚Äôt lower her mask for anyone. Proceeded to shout at the lady who was so confused she thought she had to wait 3 days to get seen. Another gal came in pregnant with possible bleeding & was told without any kind of compassion she wouldn‚Äôt be able to get help there & needed to go to the ER. The receptionist lacks any kind of customer care skills and should really not be working this kind of job.

I had woken up very early to go online to ""hold my spot"" for a preferred time so I didn't have to wait ages (my favorite thing this clinic offers - I find my preferred time and select it, then go in at the saved time and I'm usually the next one on the list to be seen).

Dr McKenzie (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong) was great and came in briefly to say she was seeing another patient right now but would be in as soon as she could. That was nice. About 20 mins later she came in and examined my lip again but she thinks with the med course I'm on, and that with the improvement I've had since I originally came in it should resolve on its own.

The female receptionist was so rude to a patient that they literally broke down into tears.

This receptionist was briefly rude to me but thankfully she didn‚Äôt make me cry. I was waiting for a while and witnessed her cut people off while they were speaking, yell at them to stand in specific places to be helped, and complain about the energy of the waiting room.

Optum - Madison Center,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"I made an appointment with Dr. Judy Han via my health care service last November, scheduling for mid January. (I never met Dr. Han so this isn't a review of her as a doctor.)

I have been to this building before, but this time, I was on time to my appointment but took a wrong turn that took me back onto the freeway. This was going to make me 10 minutes late (according to Maps). I began trying to call the doctor's office and that's where things really went sideways.

As other reviews note, speaking to a human being at the doctor's office is virtually impossible from their phone system. I called the office number and got a lengthy phone tree, no option for ""speak to the actual physician's desk"". I stayed on hold for 5 minutes with the 'general' line before giving up on it, then called back again and chose the scheduling line. This time I got a very nice and sympathetic person *in Northgate* who talked me through the directions.

By this time I had passed by the building again but for some reason Google Maps gave me the entrance on the far side of the building, which isn't accessible. And from the north side of the building if you pass the building, one-way streets send you across the freeway again.

Despite all this, the person on the phone was able to contact the front desk for me, and got a response from the medical assistant saying that I had until 3:15. Once I came by the building again, I saw an ambulance in front of it, which might be why Maps sent me the wrong way? Who knows. I made it to the garage at 3:13 and said I hope I can make it upstairs in 2 minutes. She said ""I believe in you!"" and thus ended by far the nicest interaction I had with Optum.

I did make it upstairs by 3:15 (I checked my watch AFTER I had greeted the assistant at the front desk). She seemed confused and did something for a few minutes at the computer. She said ""I'll have to check with the medical assistant"" and left.

The OBGYN office is quite large with maybe 20 chairs in the waiting room. There was one other patient in the room.

The assistant presumably spoke with the medical assistant who had said I had until 3:15 to arrive. Nonetheless she came back and said ""we'll have to reschedule your appointment"". I didn't argue with her, because at this point I was determined not to come back. Did the medical assistant know I had in fact arrived by 3:15? I have no idea. Did they know I actually had been there (within 100 feet) at 3:00 but unable to access the building? No idea. Had I been able to reach the desk by phone myself at 3 maybe all of this could have been avoided, but the phone system doesn't allow it. Oh, I HAD gotten a text message asking if I was there at 3:45 -- and I clicked the button saying I was ""nearby"" and would be there in 15 minutes. It said ""we'll check back at 3:03"". Nothing ever checked back (was someone supposed to call me? Again -- no idea).

I took off work and waited two months for this appointment. The next available appointment was at the end of February. But at this point I'll find another doctor. An office that can't adapt to emergent situations from patients is going to drop the ball in other ways, and I didn't want to find out how. Dr. Han clearly has plenty of patients and won't miss me, but in case this can warn anyone else away from the system -- if you can avoid it, do.

Edited to add:
""Patient Experience Team"", replying to my message with a form response asking me to contact another department in your overly complex system is an example of why I am seeking care elsewhere. I gave a lot of detail above, including enough to identify who I am. If you would like even more of my time your office may contact me.",1/15/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Optum - Madison Center,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"If my review were based solely off of the level of care I've received, it would be 5 stars. Everyone I've personally interacted with here has been incredibly professional. The nurses are always super friendly, and my PCP (Dr. Parle-Pechera) is awesome.

After the Optum rebrand, it really feels like the billing department has started nickel and diming me. My insurance hasn't changed, but Optum changed the way that they bill/code certain procedures that results in me having to pay out of pocket for procedures that used to be 100% covered.

At my recent annual checkup, I discussed ongoing management of my ADHD. Optum decided to bill my insurance over $300 for the ""privilege"" of talking to my doctor about an existing health condition during an appointment that was otherwise fully covered by insurance. I have been having the exact same discussion with my PCP for the last several years, but this year is the first time that I've had to pay for it. This goes for some routine lab work that I've had done for the last several years - this year was the first time I've had to pay out of pocket.

I've noticed that the claims Optum files with my insurance are much more itemized than before - I always get the flu shot and COVID booster at my annual checkup, and they have never been itemized out into separate charges. This year, I had separate line items for each vaccine as well as for the actual administration of each vaccine along with several other generic line items for ""medical service"".

I once spent over 20 hours trying to get my neurologist's office on the phone for an annual reauthorization of my medication - my insurance even sat on the phone with me for over an hour and a half and the very nice woman was blown away. She'd never heard of any doctors office, let alone a giant practice, not answer their phone or respond to faxes about prescription. My PCP is nice but you can tell they are told to go go go there and my annual physical was maybe 8 minutes and hardly covered anything. So many people have left this practice. By the way, Swedish is also terrible, maybe worst, so don't go there either.

For pregnancy, my care was great, although a lot of providers have left. They have a cool new service where you basically log on via video and just talk to a provider without even needing an appointment. That was great. But I definitely cannot recommend them to new patients.",8/26/24,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Optum - Madison Center,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"I spoke to billing and insurance. An automated recording stated after my phone call there will be a survey for feedback. After I was done with talking to customer service the lady wouldnt hang up to take me to the survey. She intentionally waited for the caller to hang up to avoid any feedback. Any ideas why? Yes you guess right, poor service, she has this annoyed attitued. As if you are bothering her. I didnt know she was going to pull that stunt so after her service I just waited for her to hang up. She pretended to not know how to hang up on her side. Was interesting to witness.

Franciscan Urgent Care - West Seattle,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"I cannot express enough gratitude for the exceptional care that Nurse Practitioner John provided for my daughter, Emma. After our initial visit to another urgent care facility, we were left feeling anxious and uncertain about her condition. Despite the urgent care's oversight, John was thorough and attentive during our appointment. He took the time to listen to our concerns and performed a comprehensive examination.

It was clear from the start that John was dedicated to getting to the bottom of Emma's illness. He quickly recognized the symptoms that were overlooked previously and ordered the necessary tests that ultimately confirmed pneumonia. His swift action not only led to a proper diagnosis but also ensured that Emma received the right treatment without delay.

What truly stood out about John was his compassionate approach. He took the time to explain everything to us in a way that was easy to understand, easing our worries as parents. He also provided us with valuable information on how to support Emma‚Äôs recovery at home, which made a significant difference.

Thanks to John's expertise and caring nature, Emma is now on the mend and returning to her joyful self. We are incredibly grateful for his help and highly recommend him to anyone in need of medical care. His commitment to his patients is truly commendable, and we can't thank him enough for what he has done for our family.",2/5/25,5,POSITIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Harborview Medical Center,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me but looking at the reviews, it‚Äôs not just me. I came into the Emergency Department after a very scary medical  complication. I had never been in this amount of pain in my life. And I had never seen that much blood. I needed an ultrasound and a couple tests. I wasn‚Äôt asked if I needed water or a snack or blankets or anything. When I was told to go pee in a cup, the bathrooms made me feel SO immensely disgusting. There was poop and blood and vomit ALL OVER THE BATHROOM from the person who had previously used it and in the other bathroom had some dude who was having withdrawals. When I was walked to the back, I get that it‚Äôs really busy and chaotic, but there was ZERO privacy. This man had literal foam coming out of his mouth probably from a withdrawal and nobody seemed to be paying any attention or had any genuine concern or reason to pick up the speed. In fact the nurses were having the time of their lives laughing and running around like they didn‚Äôt chose this career to HELP PEOPLE?! I had to voice my whole story in-front of the whole ER which should be a HIPPA violation. I was there for 12 hours in agony and disgust of the state of this emergency rooms. Do not come here if you are looking for good bedside manner, up to standard rooms/ health codes, 10+ hour wait times. And NO FREAKING PARKING. I drove through THREE entire parking garages until I found one and then had to walk all the way across the entire hospital to get to the emergency room.

Harborview Medical Center,Seattle,urgent care,healthcare,"I‚Äôm never step a foot in the ER. I spent a total of 10 hours there‚Äîeight hours waiting for a CT scan and two additional hours before antibiotics were even administered. My doctor sent me to the ER to rule out possible diverticulitis and any perforation.

Diverticulitis is chronic for me, and trips to the ER are, unfortunately, common for the same reason. But In my previous experiences at other ERs, a CT scan and the necessary treatment have rarely taken more than two or three hours. Ten hours is absolutely excessive and inexcusable. Because of this, I will not return to your facility, nor will I recommend it to anyone else.

I hope you will take immediate steps to address these systemic delays and improve patient care. Training your staff to say, ‚ÄúThank you for your patience; we know it‚Äôs a long wait,‚Äù is not enough. Patients need more than sympathy‚Äîwe need concrete actions. Considering that an ER visit can cost at least $8,000 (according to my bills) to such delays are both outrageous and inexcusable.

A possible solution you should consider is providing an estimated wait time for patients‚Äîusing historical data and the severity of their conditions should be enough and easy to do ‚Äîand, if necessary, recommending other ERs with potentially shorter wait times.",1/4/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Total Access Urgent Care - St. Louis Hills,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"The following is a summary of my experience yesterday after experiencing several days  of flu/cold issues.
I got an appointment for 2:10 but was not taken to an exam room until almost 3 pm.  When I first arrived, no one acknowledged my presence which was disappointing.The black clerk finally got off the computer and checked me in but did an incomplete job.  She didn‚Äôt even notice I had no insurance in the system until later.  While waiting, I asked what happened to the TV watching.  The two clerks told me Urgent Care decided to cancel it.

When I got to the exam room, I was seen by an EMT who was terrific.  She communicated clearly unlike the PA I saw soon after.  While awaiting for the lab results, I saw a remote control on the counter and, big surprise, the TV turned on!

The PA was impatient that I could not understand her questions behind her mask.  I felt like I was being interrogated and my answers were being questioned.  She said I should return in a few days if I didn‚Äôt get better. I asked about a prescription decongestant or something similar.  I‚Äôd gotten something like this before and it really helped.  She Categorically said no waving her hands around the room to indicate there was nothing to be done and the visit was over.

So, in the interest of being transparent, in my career I have worked in urgent care both in the lab, assisting the PA/NPs and later managing the unit.  I understand that it was a miserable day weather-wise and no one likes working weekends - so don‚Äôt be there if you can‚Äôt be more supportive and professional.  My experience left me going home frustrated and no better off than when I walked in.

In closing, I am hoping someone from this organization reads this and addresses the problem.  There are several  places to receive urgent care.  This is not the only one.  TY!",2/18/25,1,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Only improvement I would suggest was it did take a very long time to actually get seen and waiting for the medication to be administered.  Could be due to short staffing or number of patients. Otherwise, I recommend this urgent care.",2/12/25,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews
Total Access Urgent Care - Town & Country,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"I used this Total Access Urgent Care before, and my experience was great. Today was a different story. The young lady in front that checked me in was friendly and professional, but that was it. I booked a time online (lots of times were available) and I knew even though my time was set for 2:34 PM, I will probably have a wait, no problem. However, I left after waiting too long to be called to the back, and a gentleman before who was called back 30 minutes prior, went up the front desk and asked if he had been skipped because he had been waiting too. I asked about what the wait time would continue to look like, and was told it would be between 60-90 minutes. UNACCEPTABLE! I took off work to been seen at 2:34 PM, not a total of a possibility of 2 hours. If they were this far behind, there should not have been ANY open spots online until the wait time was manageable. Either upper management drives the online available spots, or the Urgent Care staff at this location moves at the slowest speed I have ever seen for a medical place. I am truly disappointed and again, I will need to take off tomorrow to try and be seen.",12/11/24,2,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

You did not even hand my daughter in law the clipboard to fill out the necessary paperwork that you held in your hand after you realized he had been seen at a hospital. He laid in your room and told you he was having difficulty breathing. You all did not care. Of course my daughter in law called 911 after you made it clear that you would not lift one finger for him. You lacked any ounce of compassion. Do not try to double down on your actions as it is clear based on the number of complaints that you have that you lack the capacity and willingness to uphold your immoral decisions. What kind of urgent care takes no accountability and argues with every single customer who says they were wronged by your facility. I agree with all their complaints, your staff is rude and incapable of showing human decency. You failed my son and it is by the grace of God that another facility helped him and treated us with the respect we did not receive from you all. You should be ashamed.

St. Louis Medical Professionals Urgent Care,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"If you are in the medical profession soley for the money, PLEASE PLEASE get out !

After being told it would be 8 hours before my husband could be seen at Barnes Jewish Hospital, St. Louis,Mo after being rushed to the hospital via ambulance, we left AMA (yes thats our right) after watching him cry out in absolute agony telling me he was having difficulty breathing and chest pain. There were more critical patients ahead of him.

I have patronized St. Louis Medical Professionals, LLC several times before and never had any complaints until yesterday. The doctor REFUSED to even look at him , assess him, come in the room, take a temperature, or show an inch of compassion because ‚Äú he would not get paid for the visit‚Äù. They stated that because he was seen at Barnes they wouldn‚Äôt get paid. They wouldn‚Äôt even dial 911 for us to have him transported anywhere else. I dial 911 for them to send out an ambulance. When Affton EMS arrive, even they were outraged and astonished that they wouldn‚Äôt do anything for a patient due to payment. Mind you I know everybody does NOT have insurance, what if I was a cash paying patient ???? I COULD have and WOULD have PAID ANY AMOUNT to have my husband treated. Furthermore, the doctor was discussing with his staff as he would not say one word to us on how people think that being transported by ambulance means something & he would wait 8 hours anywhere we went.

Mercy Hospital South took him IMMEDIATELY as they discovered he had SEVERE HYPERKALEMIA which is life threatening and requires immediate medical assistance. He did not wait in the emergency room, was given a bed & treated promptly !

I‚Äôd give no stars if I could.

Total Access Urgent Care - Creve Coeur,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"Yesterday we scheduled online to be seen at 3:26. We were transferred to the Creve Coeur location because our location was too busy. We received a couple of texts pushing the appointment forward, to 5:08 then 5:18.

When we arrived, she told me that they weren't really appointments and that she didn't know when my children would be seen. They'd been vomiting and had diarrhea, which I both told them on the phone and wrote under the ""reason for being seen"".

So at 8 we're seen and they ask what the symptoms were. Asked if there were sore throats or anything like that and we said no, so of course they tested for Strep?!?! ü§î

Then a man in white doctors coat comes in and before even examining our children or asking questions, says ""I really don't think I'm going to be any help"". So I asked as calmly as I can. You can't run stool samples, do any kind of blood work, diagnostics of any sort or prescribe anti nausea or anti diarrheal medication? He said no. Said I should have taken them to the ER.

Mind you... this after sitting in the lobby with crying children for 3 hours!!!!!!!! After they took the $100 copay for a job that he apparently knew that he wouldn't be able to perform.  And charging our insurance for a test unrelated to the presenting symptoms or complaints?!

At ANY point, he could have said, ""I really don't want to allow your poor sick kids to sit here for 3 hours when I'm just dressed as a doctor and have no intention of helping them. You should just skip the waiting an entire day to be seen and go to the ER""!!! But nope... Then he preceded to insinuate that I was a bad mom for not wanting to drive from there now, to the ER.

After being told it would be 8 hours before my husband could be seen at Barnes Jewish Hospital, St. Louis,Mo after being rushed to the hospital via ambulance, we left AMA (yes thats our right) after watching him cry out in absolute agony telling me he was having difficulty breathing and chest pain. There were more critical patients ahead of him.

I have patronized St. Louis Medical Professionals, LLC several times before and never had any complaints until yesterday. The doctor REFUSED to even look at him , assess him, come in the room, take a temperature, or show an inch of compassion because ‚Äú he would not get paid for the visit‚Äù. They stated that because he was seen at Barnes they wouldn‚Äôt get paid. They wouldn‚Äôt even dial 911 for us to have him transported anywhere else. I dial 911 for them to send out an ambulance. When Affton EMS arrive, even they were outraged and astonished that they wouldn‚Äôt do anything for a patient due to payment. Mind you I know everybody does NOT have insurance, what if I was a cash paying patient ???? I COULD have and WOULD have PAID ANY AMOUNT to have my husband treated. Furthermore, the doctor was discussing with his staff as he would not say one word to us on how people think that being transported by ambulance means something & he would wait 8 hours anywhere we went.

Mercy Hospital South took him IMMEDIATELY as they discovered he had SEVERE HYPERKALEMIA which is life threatening and requires immediate medical assistance. He did not wait in the emergency room, was given a bed & treated promptly !

I‚Äôd give no stars if I could.

Total Access Urgent Care - St. Louis Hills,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"The following is a summary of my experience yesterday after experiencing several days  of flu/cold issues.
I got an appointment for 2:10 but was not taken to an exam room until almost 3 pm.  When I first arrived, no one acknowledged my presence which was disappointing.The black clerk finally got off the computer and checked me in but did an incomplete job.  She didn‚Äôt even notice I had no insurance in the system until later.  While waiting, I asked what happened to the TV watching.  The two clerks told me Urgent Care decided to cancel it.

When I got to the exam room, I was seen by an EMT who was terrific.  She communicated clearly unlike the PA I saw soon after.  While awaiting for the lab results, I saw a remote control on the counter and, big surprise, the TV turned on!

The PA was impatient that I could not understand her questions behind her mask.  I felt like I was being interrogated and my answers were being questioned.  She said I should return in a few days if I didn‚Äôt get better. I asked about a prescription decongestant or something similar.  I‚Äôd gotten something like this before and it really helped.  She Categorically said no waving her hands around the room to indicate there was nothing to be done and the visit was over.

So, in the interest of being transparent, in my career I have worked in urgent care both in the lab, assisting the PA/NPs and later managing the unit.  I understand that it was a miserable day weather-wise and no one likes working weekends - so don‚Äôt be there if you can‚Äôt be more supportive and professional.  My experience left me going home frustrated and no better off than when I walked in.

Novus Health,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"Not having insurance currently, this was the only option I had. Some good points but also some bad ones.
Good: Nice facility. Very clean. Very large. Receptionists were nice enough and helpful. Nurses and people who work in the back and take tests, etc., were excellent. Treatment was free.
Bad: If you're a walk in, be prepared to wait all day to be seen for whatever reason.  Even though it seems empty most of the time, they say they're swamped, even if there's no cars in the parking lot.  Very confusing.
The nurse practitioner I saw didn't exactly have the best bedside manner. He came off as unenthusiastic and like I was wasting his time. Had a bit of a snotty attitude both in person and over the phone.
I observed that they aren't really discreet. They were asking people verbally out loud in front of others if they had positive test results out in the lobby, even over the phone, and that's isn't very professional in my opinion.
Receptionists also shouldn't eat lunch at the receptionist desk in front of patients.

Mercy-GoHealth Urgent Care,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"Overall a nice urgent care. On 1/1/24 arrived at 9:22 for a 9:30 appointment, in room by 9:45, nurse by 9:50, seen by the doctor by 10:10, out by 10:21.

My only complaint is that on 12/31/23 I walked in and was told that they were at capacity and I needed to reserve a time online. I don't go to urgent care a ton, but every time that I've been to one it was always walk-in rather than by an appointment. Maybe most urgent cares are by appointment now but that was confusing for me because if I wanted to make an appointment, wouldn't it make sense to just do that with my regular doctor. This is likely just an error on my part as I didn't realize that urgent cares now required an appointment.",1/1/24,4,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Mercy-GoHealth Urgent Care,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"I rarely give 5 stars because I feel there's always room for improvement. Here I see none. They where very courteous on the phone and flexible with my schedule. They took 100% of my Medicaid insurance with no out of pocket expenses. I walked in and before I even got my coat off I was being taken to an examination room. Where they tested me for COVID, Flu, and strep throat. Very thero and efficient. Through the whole examination they were over the top polite. I would highly recommend coming here if you have cold like symptoms and will also be returning if I do expense flu like symptoms again. I'll update this after they prescribe me medicine, and how effective they were with that outcome.",1/25/25,5,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Which means you won't have a personal relationship with your service provider.
Other than that. Okay physical exam and consideration. ü§∑ Appointment can be cancelled for any reason by Doctor. However you can't. Appointments will be one maybe two months wait. It's really frustrating if you're really having issues üòî",2/8/24,2,NEGATIVE,Reddit & Google Reviews

Without asking or greeting me. Ma'am you can have seat but I don't know if we can see you today. Because you didn't register downstairs well I kept trying to get help but I nothing.

Betty Jean Kerr People's Health centers,St Louis,urgent care,healthcare,"Called Friday morning to set appointments for my two kids. Was told that due to cancellations they were able to fit my kids in that day at 1:45 and 2:30 PM. We went to PHC on Delamar, checked in at front desk and was told to wait in lobby. We waited a good 40 minutes as even people who came in after us were being called and seen. When they finally called me and my kids to the desk they told me my kids were not on the schedule and told me they didn't take walk ins. They then proceeded to ""schedule"" me but I turned around and walked out. Monday I got an automated call about my kids missing their appointment, I called the office back and was told my kids we're indeed scheduled for that day and could be rescheduled in November. I can't wait that long to get a vaccine for my kids school. It was a waste of time and money, unprofessional, and unorganized.

No one likes to spend an entire day waiting to be seen at a hospital & then seen in either the order you came in or based on the severity of what you may have, and I'm sure the nursing staff don't care for the flood of people either.
